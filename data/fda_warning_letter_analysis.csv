fda_01,Electronic Mail,"Oct. 11, 2018","The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewedhttp://www.hellocig.com and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).
 
FDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquids violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are directed to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA. 
 
Additionally, FDA has determined that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)) and misbranded under sections 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). 
 
Section 301(tt) Violation
 
FDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquid products violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:
 
“[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation directed to consumers with respect to a tobacco product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would mislead consumers into believing, that—
(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;
(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be safe for use by consumers;
(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use by consumers; or
(4)   the product is safe or less harmful by virtue of—
(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or
(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration…”
 
Specifically, certain e-liquid products are sold or distributed on the website to consumers in the United States with the statements: “99.9% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA,” and “The 100% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA”: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L. Because these statements or representations on the website are directed to consumers and convey, mislead, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA, they are in violation of section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act.
 
Misbranded Tobacco Products
 
FDA has also determined that certain e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)). Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its “labeling is false or misleading in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is false or misleading in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.
                                    
Unapproved New Drug Violations
 
The E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are available for purchase on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:
 
“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. 
 
“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.
 
“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are sold on the website under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.
 
An advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, “WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”
 
Cialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. 
 
Additionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
 
These products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  
 
Misbranded Drugs
 
As described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. 
 
Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). 
 
E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.
 
Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).
 
The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. 
 
Your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)).

Dear Ms. Kesler,
 
FDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated animal food facility located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.
 
In addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:
1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” lot code #10/02/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. 
2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  
 
Adulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations
 
FDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. 
 
1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, lot code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. 
 
Your June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         
 
2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:
 
a.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)
b.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags
c.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags
d.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)
e.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags
 
Your June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.
 
Conclusion
 
The above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
 
In addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer’s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.
 
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.
 
Furthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.
 
In addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  Please see our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.
 
You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations from occurring again. More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.

9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7
Gilman, Minnesota 56333
 
Dear Mr. Bonovsky:
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. 
 
The presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.
 
Medicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.
 
Adulterated Animal Food
 
During our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  “Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]
 
Medicated Feed CGMP Violations
 
The violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. 
 
Your batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.
 
Additionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. 
 
2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.
 
Your medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.
 
3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.
 
Our investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.
 
To date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.
 
Conclusion
 
The above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
 
Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.
 
(b)(3)(A)
 
The Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.
Such foods are “Reportable Foods.”  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).
 
Furthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   
 
In addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please see FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.
 
You should respond in writing within 15 business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again.  More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections cannot be completed within 15 business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.
 
Please send your written response to Dianna C. Sonnenburg, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, at 250 Marquette Ave, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55401. If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Mrs. Sonnenburg at (612) 758-7125.

fda_03,UPS OVERNIGHT DELIVERY,"September 04, 2018","On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a complaint (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  
 
Also, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  
 
The presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.
 
After FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. 
 
Prior Samples
 
We note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.

On June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).
 
Public Health Impact of Pathogens
 
Unlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. 
 
Salmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf
 
Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. 
 
Antimicrobial Treatments
 
During the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. 
 
Any substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). 
 
We received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.
 
We also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.
 
Conclusion
 
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
 
In addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:
 
We note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   
 
Starting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. For more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.
 
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
 
Your written response should be sent to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the attention of Janice L. King, Compliance Officer.  If you have questions, you may contact Ms. King at (843) 746-2990, Ext. 16.

fda_04,EXPRESS DELIVERY,"SEPT 4, 2018","Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. 
 
In accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm
 
We found the following significant deviations:  
 
1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as ""any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption."" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  
 
2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a ""point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels."" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,
 
a.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.
 
b.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.
 
3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as ""the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard."" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” critical control point your critical limit of “(b)(4)” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). 
 
You should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
 
If you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html
 
This letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.
 
Additionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.
 
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact Marco Esteves via email at marco.esteves@fda.hhs.gov.

fda_04,"OVERNIGHT DELIVERY
RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED
","September 4, 2018","This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.kratomwholesale.us in August 2018 and has determined that you take orders there for various kratom products, including but not limited to, “Bali Green Kratom Powder,” “Bali Red Kratom Powder,” “Borneo Green Kratom Powder,” “Borneo Red Vein Kratom,” “Horned Kratom Powder,” “Vietnam Kratom Powder,” “Malaysian White Vein Kratom Powder,” “Thai White Vein Kratom Powder,” “Thai Red Vein Kratom Powder,” and “Maeng Da Kratom Powder.” FDA has determined that these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
 
On October 26, 2017, the Acting Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d, determined that a public health emergency exists nationwide involving the opioid crisis. As described in more detail below, you market various kratom products for, among other things, the treatment or cure of opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms. However, these products have not been determined by FDA to be safe and effective for these (or any other) uses. Further, the unproven treatments could cause patients to forego or delay FDA-approved treatments for opioid addiction and withdrawal. The marketing and sale of unapproved opioid addiction treatment products is a potentially significant threat to the public health. Therefore, FDA is taking measures to protect consumers from products that, without approval by FDA, claim to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, treat or cure opioid addiction.
 
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
 
Claims on your website establish that the above-mentioned products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease — including opiate withdrawal and addiction, and/or because they are intended to affect the structure or function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act. 
 
Examples of claims observed on the website where you take orders, www.kratomwholesale.us, that establish the intended use of your products include, but may not be limited to the following: 
 
On the webpage titled “About Kratom”:
“Kratom can render both mildly stimulating effects and mildly relaxing effects depending upon the measurement used. At smaller amounts, the effects tend to be slightly more stimulating; and at larger amounts, the effects tend to be more relaxing.”
“Some [kratom users] have reported an increase in focus, attentiveness, and social confidence resulting from the responsible use of kratom.”
“Due to the rise in opium costs and the discovery that kratom could relieve opium withdrawals, many users turned to kratom as a means to cure their addiction.”
“It has been long reported that kratom has been used to treat a myriad of ailments including but not limited to: diarrhea, depression, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, stomach parasites, diverticulitis, anxiety, alcoholism, and opiate withdrawal.”
On the webpage with the Blog dated February 3, titled “(b)(6) Battle with Opiate Addiction”:
“One way to avoid the synthetic roller coaster of addiction is to opt for a natural alternative – kratom. Kratom has been used for hundreds of years to promote opiate withdrawal relief in Southeast Asia and is quickly gaining popularity in the United States. With the rate of opiate use on the rise, people need as many options available to them as possible when battling addiction. Learn more about kratom and how it can be the solution to promoting an opiate free lifestyle by visiting our About Kratom page”
On the webpage with the Blog dated July 17, titled “Tragic Death of (b)(6)”:
“[I]s there a better way? Yes there is – kratom. Kratom has been used for hundreds of years to help eliminate withdrawal symptoms from opiates of all kinds. Kratom has been used to treat everything from mild pain pill addiction to heroin addiction.” 
Your kratom products are also “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA. No approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), is in effect for these products. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). 
 
In addition, your kratom products are misbranded under 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), because they lack adequate directions for use. Section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), identifies criteria for determining the prescription status of a product. Your above-mentioned kratom products are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), because in light of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary to their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. 
 
Your above-mentioned kratom products are intended for the treatment or cure of opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms, and/or other conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” is defined in 21 CFR 201.5 as “directions under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended.”  Because the conditions for which your above-mentioned kratom products are intended require the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs, adequate directions cannot be written so that a layperson can use your products safely. Thus, your kratom products’ labeling fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, which causes the products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
 
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations.
 
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. 
 
Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to correct violations.

Dear Messrs. Dolezal
 
On June 5, 2018 and June 11, 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your dairy operation, Dolezal Dairy, located at 947 - 24th Road Pender, Nebraska. This letter notifies you of violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that were revealed during our investigation of your operation. You can find the FD&C Act and its associated regulations on the Internet through links on the FDA’s web page at www.fda.gov.
 
Adulteration of an Animal Offered for Human Consumption:
We found that you offered for sale an animal for slaughter as food that was adulterated. Under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), a food is deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains a new animal drug that is unsafe under section 512 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b. Further, under section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4), a food is deemed to be adulterated if it has been held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.
 
Specifically, our investigation revealed that on or about March 22, 2018, you sold a cow for slaughter as food, with a green ear tag numbered (b)(4) on the front and on the back, (b)(4) and (b)(4)(cow with ear tag (b)(4)). You sold this cow at (b)(4) on March 22, 2018, and it was subsequently slaughtered on March 23, 2018 at (b)(4). The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) analysis of tissue samples collected from this animal identified the presence of desfuroylceftiofur (marker residue for ceftiofur) at 8.649 parts per million (ppm) in kidney tissue. FDA has established a tolerance of 0.4 ppm for residues of desfuroylceftiofur in uncooked edible tissues of cattle as codified in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), section 556.113 (21 C.F.R. § 556.113). The presence of this drug in edible tissue from this animal in this amount causes the food to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii).
 
Our investigation also found that you hold animals under conditions that are so inadequate that medicated animals bearing potentially harmful drug residues are likely to enter the food supply. You lack an adequate system to ensure that animals medicated by you have been withheld from slaughter for appropriate periods of time to permit depletion of potentially hazardous residues of drugs from edible tissues. For example, you failed to maintain complete and accurate treatment records. Treatment records must include the condition being treated, dosage, route of administration, the person who administered treatment, and withdrawal times. Complete records should include this information, as well as diagnosis and indications for use.  Food from animals held under such conditions is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4).
 
Adulteration of a New Animal Drug
We also found that you adulterated the new animal drug Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline free acid, ANADA 141-209). Specifically, our investigation revealed that you did not use this drug as directed by its approved labeling. Use of this drug in this manner is an extra-label use, as defined by 21 C.F.R. § 530.3(a).
 
The extra label use of approved animal or human drugs in animals is allowed under the FD&C Act only if the extra-label use complies with sections 512(a)(4) and (5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360b(a)(4) and (5), and 21 CFR Part 530, including that the use must be by or on the lawful order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinarian/client/patient relationship. Extra-label use of this drug, if not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, may cause additional violative drug residues.
 
Our investigation found you administered Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) to a dairy cow with ear tag (b)(4) without following the indications for use and withdrawal time as stated in the approved labeling. You admitted to using Excede™ for unapproved uses including treating cow with ear tag (b)(4) with 18 mL of Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) via a subcutaneously injection behind the ear for treatment of diarrhea and fever. Excede™ is not approved for treatment for diarrhea and fever. Also, you admitted to entering the wrong date in your calendar, which caused you to sell the cow with ear tag (b)(4) before the end of the meat withdrawal period specified in the approved labeling. Your extra-label use of Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) was not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, in violation of 21 C.F.R. § 530.11(a), and resulted in illegal drug residues, in violation of 21 C.F.R. § 530.11(d). 
 
Because your use of these drugs was not in conformance with their approved labeling and did not comply with 21 C.F.R. Part 530, you caused the drugs to be unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), and adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5).
 
Prohibited Act (301h) False Guaranty
Our investigation also revealed that on or about October 13, 2011, Mark R. Dolezal, Co-Owner of Dolezal Dairy, signed a Consignor/Livestock Owner’s Certificate to (b)(4) that certifies that none of the livestock delivered to (b)(4) will have an illegal level of drug residues or the producer will inform the (b)(4) of any drugs the livestock have been given. On or about March 22, 2018, you delivered a cow from your farm to (b)(4) which contained violative residues of desfuroylceftiofur. Providing such a false guaranty is prohibited by section 301(h) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(h). You should take appropriate actions to ensure that this violation does not recur.
 
The above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a producer of animals offered for use as food, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the food you distribute is in compliance with the law.
 
You should take prompt action to correct the violations described in this letter and to establish procedures to ensure that these violations do not recur. Failure to do so may result in regulatory action without further notice, such as seizure and/or injunction. 
 
You should notify this office in writing of the steps you have taken to bring your firm into compliance with the law within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter. Your response should include each step that has been taken or will be taken to correct the violations and prevent their recurrence. If corrective action cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be completed. Please include copies of any available documentation demonstrating that corrections have been made.

Dear Mr. Ishrak:
 
During an inspection of Medtronic Puerto Rico Operations Company (MPROC), located at Ceiba Norte Industrial Park, 50 Road 31, Km 24.4, Juncos, Puerto Rico, on April 23 through May 15, 2018, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that Medtronic MPROC Juncos manufactures implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization devices, and other related products. Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.
 
This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links in FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
 
We received your firm’s responses dated June 6 and July 13, 2018, concerning our investigators’ observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), Inspectional Observations, issued to your firm on May 15, 2018. We address these responses below in relation to violations observed during the inspection, which include:
 
1.    Failure to validate a process whose results cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test according to established procedures, which is required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). Specifically, (b)(4) processes (b)(4)were not validated on Blackwell implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). These (b)(4) processes (b)(4) in ICDs that failed due to high voltage arcing. This led to your firm’s recall Z-0582/9-2018.
 
We reviewed your firm’s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process steps (b)(4), (b) update supplemental material for process validation to clarify that each (b)(4) must be assessed and challenged during process validation, (c) update the change control process to incorporate instructions on how to assess risk or unintended consequence of (b)(4), (d) assess (b)(4) processes for ICDs to determine if they were properly validated and have adequate process controls, and (e) perform an assessment of process validations for Blackwell ICDs non-fully verifiable processes to evaluate if applicable product specifications were challenged per process validation and design transfer requirements. Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance.
 
2.   Failure to document (b)(4) activities in the device history record (DHR) as required by 21 CFR 820.90(b)(2). Specifically, (b)(4) on implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) was not documented in device history records.
 
We reviewed your firm’s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process, (b) update product identification and traceability procedures to clarity that (b)(4) must be documented, (c) update your training of new hires and manufacturing personnel, (d) assess manufacturing areas to identify whether similar conduct is occurring elsewhere, and (e) establish more robust equipment and/or procedure controls on ICD equipment used in manufacturing to help prevent the occurrence of undocumented (b)(4). Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance.
 
Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.  Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected.  Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected.
 
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again.  Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.
 
Additionally, our investigators cited observations on the FDA 483 in the areas of corrective and preventive action (21 CFR 820.100), acceptance activities (21 CFR 820.80), statistical techniques (21 CFR 820.250), and inspection, measuring, and test equipment (21 CFR 820.72).  Your firm’s responses appear to adequately address these observations. Implementation and effectiveness of your corrective actions will be evaluated during a follow-up inspection.

OVERNIGHT DELIVERY
","August 24, 2018","Dear Mr. Hanson:
 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm’s medical device operations at Zimmer, Biomet, Inc., 56 East Bell Drive, Warsaw, IN, from April 9 through 24, 2018. During the inspection, FDA investigators determined that your firm is a medical device manufacturer of orthopedic implants.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.
 
This inspection revealed that your devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.
 
We acknowledge that during a Regulatory Meeting on April 27, 2017, Zimmer Biomet discussed “(b)(4),” a remediation project to address FDA’s 2016 inspectional findings. We are also aware that your firm implemented numerous interim controls as immediate containment and mitigation actions, including increased process monitoring of validated processes while remediation activities were in progress. However, our recent inspection revealed continuing, significant violations of the quality system regulations.
 
We received a response dated May 15, 2018 from Jeff Gensler, Vice President, Quality Assurance and Quality Control, which responded to the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations issued to your firm on April 24, 2018. We are also in receipt of your July 31, 2018 status update. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
1.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for verifying or validating the corrective and preventive action, to ensure that such action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4). During the inspection, review of three separate CAPA’s revealed that your firm has not been able to demonstrate that the corrective or preventive actions taken by your firm are effective in ensuring that devices being distributed meet all finished product specifications.
CAPA CA-03092, was opened on December 1, 2016 to address inadequate process validations and process control procedures for in-process and final cleaning operations that were revealed during the previous inspection. During the inspection, we observed that you are monitoring your interim cleaning processes by requiring testing for (b)(4) (i.e., cleanliness tests). Your CAPA review board is responsible for monitoring this data to ensure it is meeting your pre-established specifications. However, during the inspection we observed an instance where your own data did not demonstrate that your cleaning process was capable of meeting the established cleanliness specification for (b)(4) group devices. For example, process performance indicators (Ppk’s) for (b)(4) were (b)(4) and (b)(4) from 1/28/2018 to 3/30/2018 and 12/16/2017 to 3/20/2018, respectively, which was well below your specification of (b)(4) as required in INST 28.0.0.1 (b)(4).
We are concerned about your firm’s ability to verify the effectiveness of the corrective actions included in this CAPA, when errors are not being identified in your interim processes.
 
In response to this Warning Letter, you should address specific steps you are taking to address the products that may require additional remediation. You should also address how you plan to oversee your CAPA program to ensure that you are confident that all corrective actions taken by your firm are verified to be effective.
 
2.    Failure to adequately ensure that when the results of a process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test that the process shall be validated with a high degree of assurance and approved according to established procedure, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a).
Your firm has not established that the (b)(4) of a (b)(4) constitutes a greater challenge to (b)(4) than the (b)(4) or (b)(4). Specifically, in your firm’s Zimmer Biomet “SUMMARY REPORT” of April 18, 2018, states on page (b)(4)section 8.4.2.2.2, that: 
(b)(4)
 
However, it is unclear if establishing (b)(4), alone, conveys equivalent process lethality. (b)(4) may be established during the conditioning and exposure phases, however effective (b)(4) occurs only during the exposure phase. It remains unclear whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) were adequately evaluated for process lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4). This is especially of concern since the (b)(4) are described as solid in construction; typically meaning (b)(4).
 
We are concerned about your firm’s ability to evaluate whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) for process lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4) because it is unclear if excluding these (b)(4) from testing is justified.
 
In response to this Warning Letter, you should address the specific steps your firm is taking for products that are currently in distribution and may require additional remediation. You should also address how you plan to oversee your sterilization validation program to ensure that you are confident that all corrective actions taken by your firm are verified to be effective.
In regards to Sterilization Cycle (b)(4), it is unclear if the (b)(4) of (b)(4) might additionally impede (b)(4) in the (b)(4). Specifically, in the protocol for Cycle (b)(4), “LOADING CONFIGURATION” Section 2, states: “(b)(4).” This portrays a load configuration consisting of (b)(4); all consisting of (b)(4). This indicates (b)(4) with (b)(4), with the mass of (b)(4). Product in the (b)(4) may present this as an additional (b)(4) challenge.
We are concerned about your firm’s ability to perform microbiological challenge testing. It is unclear which location(s), within (b)(4), and among (b)(4), constitutes the worst-case challenge in the load configuration for sterilization.
 
In response to this Warning Letter, you should address the specific steps your firm is taking for products that are currently in distribution and may require additional remediation. You should also address how you plan to oversee your sterilization validation program to ensure that you are confident that all corrective actions taken by your firm are verified to be effective.
 
3.    Failure to develop, conduct, control and monitor production processes to ensure that a device confirms to its specifications, including the monitoring and control of process parameters and device characteristics during production, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(a)(2). During the inspection. we observed five separate operations in which employees on the production line were not following production procedures adequately. For example:
On April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) manual cleaning area was observed to be cleaning (b)(4), with a nylon brush. This individual indicated they were on step (b)(4) of the cleaning procedure, WCLN017 - Work Instruction Clean – (b)(4). The employee had already  (b)(4) and was using a nylon brush to remove debris from the devices. The work instruction indicated that the (b)(4) and a wire brush was to be used to remove debris. A wire brush was not observed at the work station. The employee stated they use a nylon brush, instead of a wire brush, as the wire brush can scratch the polished surfaces. (the polished surface was previously covered with the (b)(4).)
On April 17, 2018, an employee was observed measuring part (b)(4), for specification (b)(4) as part of their line clearance activities. According to drawing, (b)(4), specification (b)(4) upper limit should measure (b)(4) with a tolerance (b)(4). The employee measured this specification (b)(4) for the first part as (b)(4) and the second part as (b)(4) and stated the part was “good.” These measurements were not identified as non-conformances until the operator was directly asked what the specification was and if the parts were conforming.
On April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) packaging area was observed packing finished (b)(4). They were using a (b)(4)” gauge to measure the tray seal in the metal packaging area. Your firm’s Package Requirements - I00051.3 states that the narrowest seal width for Seal Width-Trays is “not less than (b)(4)”.” Your employee stated that the only gauge at her station was the (b)(4)” gauge.
On April 9, 2018, a sterile sealing process was observed. An employee was performing sealing operations using a (b)(4) sealer. The employee was not able to demonstrate how to measure seal width using a gauge as required your Package Requirements - I00051.3. The operator incorrectly measured an area outside of the blister package seal.
On April 11, 2018, we observed the sterile packaging operation using Sealer (b)(4). This sealer was identified as a legacy sealer whose process validation was found to be inadequate. Your firm has been relying on appropriate process monitoring to justify the continued use of this sealer. Heat Sealing Parameter Sheet (HSPS) for (b)(4) Sealer provides instructions for taking a total of (b)(4) samples for process monitoring testing and SOP 28.0.3 Sterile Packaging Sealer Monitoring step (b)(4), indicates samples should be submitted in order to demonstrate test results are obtained over the time the sterile packaging equipment was in operation. However, during the inspection, Your Quality Technician stated he performs seal integrity testing only on samples from the (b)(4) and seal strength testing only on samples taken at the (b)(4). 
The above examples were discussed during the inspection as a failure of establishing sufficient training procedures, so your response does not address the above violation. We are aware that, by (b)(4). However, this time frame is inadequate. In response to this Warning Letter, you should provide a detailed description of how you are ensuring that all employees are currently performing routine manufacturing operations in accordance with required procedures and in accordance with 21 CFR 820.70.
 
4.    Failure to establish and maintain design validation procedures to ensure proper risk analysis is completed, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g). For example:
During the inspection, we reviewed a Process Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) #PF0700, dated November 2, 2017, as part of the design history file for your comprehensive shoulder implant, (product: XL‐115363). This review confirmed inconsistencies in the assignment of potential severity ratings for hazards identified during design review. For example, the failure effect of “Compromise of the product Sterility” is given severity of scores of “(b)(4)” (necessitates minor medical intervention) or “(b)(4)” (results in permanent impairment of body function or damage to body structure/ necessitates surgical intervention) for different potential failure modes. This failure effect regarding sterility was assigned a level of “(b)(4)” for (b)(4) line items and a level of “(b)(4)” in (b)(4) line items in this PFMECA. Using a severity level of “(b)(4)” for the failure effect of product sterility for all failure modes would result in (b)(4) of the hazard lines exceeding the acceptable level of (b)(4) which would require further mitigation by your firm. 
Your response is not adequate to address the above violation. Your response indicates that you are aware of historical inconsistencies in the assignment of severity scores for failure modes at Zimmer Biomet. We are aware that you opened CAPA 02719 in July 2016 to remediate all Zimmer’s design history files as part of your (b)(4). We acknowledge you opened CAPA CA04257 on February 7, 2018 to update risk management files and that this CAPA includes a plan to remediate and revise all existing pFMECAS’s under (b)(4) by (b)(4). In previous correspondence (March 29, 2018), you have also indicated that all design history files (DHFs) for implants and instruments will be evaluated and either remediated to current design control standards or rationalized and obsoleted by the (b)(4). However, to date, no DHF’s have undergone complete remediation. (See CAPA 02179 Timeline)
 
We are concerned that recent design reviews conducted by your firm under (b)(4) continue to demonstrate inconsistencies. As discussed in FDA-483 item 1.C, we also observed that you have not taken a plenary “risk based” approach when performing device performance reviews as part of design reviews. In response to this Warning Letter, you should provide your plan to ensure that the design history work currently being performed by (b)(4) has been consistent and is capable of providing the required assurance that design history reviews are compliant moving forward.
 
5.    Where environmental conditions could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on product quality, failure to establish and maintain procedures to adequately control these environmental conditions, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(c). For example:
During our inspection, we observed that at least forty non-conformance reports (NCR’s) have been initiated for microbial environmental action-limit excursions in controlled areas since March 17, 2017. Twenty-two of these NCR's did not include an investigation into the cause of the excursion when action levels were exceeded. For example, NCR 12185873 dated October 20, 2017 noted a microbial surface plate exceeded the action limit. The NCR did not include any investigation as to a potential cause, including further identification of the organism. Your SOP 9.5.15 - Environmental Monitoring of Environmentally Controlled Areas, requires that an investigation be conducted immediately when action levels are exceeded.
Also, on April 9, 2018, we observed the inspection of shoulder cup implants (item number TI- 115310, under an ISO Class 8 hood at the end of the (b)(4). We observed that racks and carriers (mailboxes) used to transport work order documentation for the (b)(4) process are not sanitized, even though they are routinely sent back to the hood from the uncontrolled environment through a pass-through. SOP 9.5.17 - Environmentally Controlled Areas: Cleanroom and Work Environment Practices, requires that all equipment be sanitized prior to placing it into the environmentally controlled hood. Firm personnel indicated that mailboxes were being reused indefinitely and entering the hood environment with no evidence of ever being sanitized. 
Your response indicates that you have updated your procedures to ensure investigations into excursions are investigated and documented properly. You also indicated that your firm has discontinued the use of mailboxes and opened CAPA CA-04521 to address employee practices in this area. We will need to verify during a re-inspection that these actions are effective in ensuring environmental conditions are being controlled properly
 
6.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions, including requirements for analyzing processes, work operations, concessions, quality audit reports, quality records, service records, complaints, returned product, and other sources of quality data to identify existing and potential causes of nonconforming product, or other quality problems, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(1). For example:
Your firm did not review common cause rework (CCR) data as a quality data source, during the months of January and February 2018, as required by your Work instruction #WI070002 -  NCR Quality Trending.  In addition, your other procedures - CP01602, SOP016001, and SOP070001 - do not address CCRs as a part of your quality metric review process.
We observed that only one defect code was assigned to at least four Non-Conforming Reports (NCR) that were identified to having multiple deficiencies documented in a single record. For example, NCR12197758, NCR12226291, NCR12220917 and NCR12177720.
Your corrective action cannot be assessed at this time. Your response states that you will be revising your SOPs and work instructions to ensure that CCR data will be reviewed. We also understand that you are updating your (b)(4) system to improve your ability to trend NCRs with multiple defect codes.  In response to this Warning Letter, please provide your revised SOPs and work instructions.
 
Your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated  by  the  FDA  without  further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected.
 
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.
 
We propose a Regulatory Meeting to discuss this recent inspection. At this meeting, you should be prepared to discuss the status of your proposed corrections. Please contact our office to schedule a convenient date and time.
 
If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Compliance Officer, Karen Archdeacon at 781-587-7491 or at karen.archdeacon@fda.hhs.gov. Please send your reply electronically to Gina Brackett, Director of Compliance Branch, at gina.brackett@fda.hhs.gov.
 
Finally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483,  issued  at  the  close  of  the  inspection  may  be  symptomatic  of  serious  problems  in  your  firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems.  Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.

NEXT DAY - SIGNATURE REQUIRED
",,"Dear Mr. Vázquez Borrero:
 
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your food manufacturing facility located at Calle Guadalupe # 62, Ponce, Puerto Rico, on May 21, 2018 through June 01, 2018. Our inspection found you have repeat violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations in manufacturing, packing, or holding human food, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 110.[1[i]] These violations cause your food product(s) to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act and FDA regulations in the CFR through links in FDA's website at www.fda.gov.
 
During our inspection of your facility, our investigator’s observations were noted on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on June 01, 2018.
 
The significant CGMP violations were as follows:
 
1.    You failed to take effective measures to exclude pests from the processing areas and to protect against contamination of food on the premises by pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.35(c). Specifically, on 05/21/2018 and 05/22/2018 our investigator observed dead roaches’ parts too numerous to count in your firm's warehouse floor next to ambient temperature raw materials such as sodium benzoate, dry onions, garlic granules, and oregano. You were previously cited for the same or similar violation during the 2009 and 2015 inspections.
 
2.    Your firm failed to take all reasonable precautions to ensure that production procedures do not contribute to contamination from any source, as required by 21 CFR 110.80. Specifically, during the inspection our investigator observed while manufacturing various products with Lot No. 9450, such as ""Sofrito Excelencia"" (Condiment Mix) and ""Ajo Puro"" (Raw Grounded Garlic) the following:
Employees in the manufacturing area where re-using disposable items as utensils. These were at least five (5) empty plastic bleach containers that were cut in halves and were being re-used as scoops and funnels for collecting and/or dispensing ingredients, processing water, and finished products filling step.
Air extractor screen in the production area was filthy and dusty, potentially allowing the falling of dust and dirt into in-process products and uncovered raw ingredients.
A pair of rubber gloves used for cleaning purposes were hanging right above exposed ""Ajo Puro"" (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished product. Repeat observation from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections. 
3.    You must store raw materials in a manner that protects against contamination, as required by 21 CFR 110.80(a)(1). Specifically, on 05/21/2018 and 05/22/2018, our investigator observed:
Ingredients such as dry onions, garlic, oregano, citric acid, and sodium benzoate stored in the ambient temperature area on top of soiled and dirty pallets. Additionally, the area was observed dusty, which could potentially contaminate ingredients.
Ingredients such as red peppers and green peppers stored in the refrigerator area on pallets against the foam type walls. These foam type walls had missing sections and were soiled with what appears to be mold. In addition, the foam type ceiling was missing sections and soiled with what appears to be mold.
Packaging cardboard boxes were stored inside your non-functional and dirty refrigerator and it had soiled walls and damaged ceiling areas.
Preservatives ingredients such as salt, sodium benzoate, and citric acid placed in your manufacturing area were not properly labeled. In addition, these ingredients were stored in filthy containers and were kept un-covered while not in use. Repeat observation from our 2010 and 2015 inspections. 
4.    You failed to properly store equipment, remove litter and waste, and cut weeds or grass within the immediate vicinity of the plant building that may constitute an attractant, breeding place, or harborage for pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.20(a)(1). Specifically, our investigator observed your firm's warehouse area, where packaging plastic bowls, plastic lids, and glass jar containers were stored, was also used to store waste material, had at least forty (40) not-in-use refrigerators, one (1) not-in-use forklift, one (1) not-in-use 300 gallons’ stainless steel tank, and old carton boxes. In addition, our investigator observed that an approximately 100 square feet area of the ceiling panels installed in your firm's warehouse were detached from the ceiling leaving openings that provide a potential breeding place for pests. Repeat observation from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections.
 
5.    The procedures used for cleaning and sanitizing of utensils must provide adequate cleaning and sanitizing treatment as required by 21 CFR 110.35(d)(5). Specifically,
The three (3)-compartment sink used to wash and sanitize glass jars re-used from returned products was not set up in the correct sequence of wash-rinse-sanitize. In addition, your firm manufacturing cleaning area does not have a three (3)-compartment sink and utensils are not properly cleaned while manufacturing is in progress.
On 05/21/2018 and 05/22/2018, our investigator observed that plastic utensils were kept inside this single compartment sink and were being cleaned with water and soap alone. Repeat observation from our 2015 inspection. 
6.    Your firm failed to provide adequate screening or other protection against pests as required by 21 CFR 110.20(b)(7).  Specifically, our investigator observed windows in processing area did not have any type of screening and doors leading to the receiving and/or dispatching of raw materials and finished products have a gap of approximately four (4) inches wide at the bottom. A second door connecting the exterior of the firm with this warehouse had a gap of approximately two (2) inches wide at the bottom. Repeat observation from our 2009 and 2015 inspections. 
 
7.    You failed to maintain buildings, fixtures or other physical facilities in a sanitary condition as required by 21 CFR 110.35(a). Specifically, our investigator observed that the floors in your processing area are not constructed from a material that could be easily cleaned and kept clean. Gaps in between floor tiles had accumulated dirt and black stains that appeared to be mold. In addition, walls in the processing area had sections of missing tiles and showed presence of what appeared to be mold. During the inspection, your firm was formulating ""Sofrito"" (Condiment Mix) and ""Ajo"" (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished products. (Repeat observation from our 2009, 2010, and 2015 inspections).
 
We note that you have not provided a written response to the Form FDA 483, Investigator Observations, issued to you on June 01, 2018. Please be aware that without a written response, we are unable to assess your understanding of the observations and any potential corrective actions to voluntarily comply with applicable regulations.
 
In addition, we have determined that your facility is subject to the biennial registration renewal requirement in § 415(a)(3) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350d(a)(3), which requires submission of a renewal registration during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, and our implementing regulation at 21 CFR Part 1, Subpart H. During the current inspection of your facility, you were advised of this requirement.  Failure to re-register a facility is a prohibited act under § 301(dd) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331 (dd).  Our records indicate that, to date, this facility has not been re-registered with FDA.
 
As a responsible official of a facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for human or animal consumption in the United States, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the products you distribute are in compliance with the law.
 
We request you register your facility with FDA within fifteen (15) working days from receipt of this letter. Registration may be accomplished on-line at http://www.access.fda.gov. We strongly encourage the use of electronic registration because it will result in an automatic confirmation of registration and automatic issuance of a registration number. Alternatively, you may register the facility by mail or fax (e.g., if you do not have reasonable access to the Internet) using FDA’s food facility registration form, Form FDA 3537. This form may be obtained by calling the FDA Industry Systems Help Desk at 1-800-216-7331 or 301-575-0156, or by writing to the Agency at the following address:
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, HFS-681
5600 Fishers Lane
Rockville, MD 20857
 
When completed, the form may be faxed to (301) 210-0247 or mailed to the address above. FDA will process registrations submitted by mail or fax and provide a facility’s registration number using the same method used to submit the registration to FDA.
 
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, Form FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing systems. You should investigate and determine the causes of the violations and take prompt actions to correct the violations to bring your products into compliance. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice including seizure and injunction.
 
Section 743 of the Act, [21 USC 379j-31], authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, [21 USC 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility.  The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.
 
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days from receipt of this letter as to the specific steps you have taken to correct the stated violations, including an explanation of each step being taken to identify violations and make corrections to ensure that similar violations will not recur. In your response, you should include documentation, including copies of records, photographs or other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be implemented.
 
Your reply should be directed to District Director, Food and Drug Administration, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223.

2180 Piney Grove Loop Road
Olivehill, Tennessee 38475
 
Dear Mr. Nesbitt:
 
On March 13 and 22, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an investigation of your cattle operation, located at 2108 Piney Grove Loop Road, Olivehill, Tennessee, as a follow up to a sulfamethazine residue that was found in a slaughtered bull. This letter notifies you of the violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that we found during our investigation of your operation. You can find the Act and its associated regulations through links on FDA’s Internet web page at www.fda.gov. 
 
We found that you hold animals under conditions that are so inadequate that medicated animals bearing potentially harmful drug residues are likely to enter the food supply. You failed to maintain treatment records and you failed to identify animals transported and delivered for sale. Food from animals held under such conditions is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 342(a)(4).
 
We also found that you adulterated the new animal drug Sustain III® Bolus (sulfamethazine, NADA 120-615). Specifically, our investigation revealed that you did not use this drug as directed by its approved labeling. Use of this drug in this manner is an extralabel use. See Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations Part 530.3(a) (21 C.F.R. § 530.3(a)).
 
The extralabel use of approved animal or human drugs in animals is allowed under the FD&C Act only if the extralabel use complies with sections 512(a)(4) and (5) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 360b(a)(4) and (5), and 21 CFR Part 530, including that the use must be by or on the lawful order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinarian/client/patient relationship. 
 
During our investigation, you admitted to administering Sustain III®, an over the counter (OTC) product, to a black bull without following the indications for use and the route of administration, as stated in the approved labeling. Under your supervision, this black bull was treated with Sustain III® for “being old and slow” by crushing and mixing three (3) boluses of Sustain III® to feed. Sustain III® is not approved for these conditions. Additionally, the label states in part “…care should be taken not to crush the bolus”. Using OTC products in an extralabel manner requires a lawfully written order from a veterinarian. Your extralabel use of Sustain III® was not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, in violation of 21 CFR § 530.11(a) as illegal extralabel use of a drug.   
 
Because your use of this drug was not in conformance with its approved labeling and did not comply with 21 CFR Part 530, you caused the drug to be unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
 
The above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a producer of animals offered for use as food, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the food you distribute is in compliance with the law.
 
You should take prompt action to correct the violations described in this letter and to establish procedures to ensure that these violations do not recur. Failure to do so may result in regulatory action without further notice such as seizure and/or injunction. 
 
You should notify this office in writing of the steps you have taken to bring your firm into compliance with the law within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter. Your response should include each step that has been taken or will be taken to correct the violations and prevent their recurrence. If corrective action cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be completed. Please include copies of any available documentation demonstrating that corrections have been made.
 
Your written response should be sent to Kimberly A. Dutzek, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 404 BNA Drive, Building 200, Suite 500, Nashville, Tennessee 37217. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Mrs. Dutzek at (615) 366-7826.
