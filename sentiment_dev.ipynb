       "      <td>The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewedhttp://www.hellocig.com and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquids violates section 301(tt) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are directed to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA. \\n \\nAdditionally, FDA has determined that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)) and misbranded under sections 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). \\n \\nSection 301(tt) Violation\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquid products violates section 301(tt) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:\\n \\n“[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation directed to consumers with respect to a tobacco product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would mislead consumers into believing, that—\\n(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\\n(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be safe for use by consumers;\\n(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use by consumers; or\\n(4)   the product is safe or less harmful by virtue of—\\n(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or\\n(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration…”\\n \\nSpecifically, certain e-liquid products are sold or distributed on the website to consumers in the United States with the statements: “99.9% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA,” and “The 100% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA”: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L. Because these statements or representations on the website are directed to consumers and convey, mislead, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA, they are in violation of section 301(tt) of the FD&amp;C Act.\\n \\nMisbranded Tobacco Products\\n \\nFDA has also determined that certain e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)). Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its “labeling is false or misleading in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&amp;C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is false or misleading in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\n                                    \\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\n \\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are available for purchase on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are sold on the website under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, “WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco and drug products into compliance with the FD&amp;C Act. \\n \\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco and drug products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to ensure full compliance with the FD&amp;C Act may result in FDA initiating further action without notice, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, criminal prosecution, seizure, and/or injunction.

During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” lot code #10/02/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, lot code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer’s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&amp;C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.

Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  “Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\n \\n2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\nSuch foods are “Reportable Foods.”  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.

       "      <td>On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a complaint (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\n \\nAny substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&amp;C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:\\n \\nWe note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  Please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food.

       "      <td>Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe found the following significant deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” critical control point your critical limit of “(b)(4)” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (&lt;0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP &amp; PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A.

       "0  The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewedhttp://www.hellocig.com and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquids violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are directed to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA. \\n \\nAdditionally, FDA has determined that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)) and misbranded under sections 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). \\n \\nSection 301(tt) Violation\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquid products violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:\\n \\n“[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation directed to consumers with respect to a tobacco product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would mislead consumers into believing, that—\\n(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\\n(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be safe for use by consumers;\\n(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use by consumers; or\\n(4)   the product is safe or less harmful by virtue of—\\n(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or\\n(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration…”\\n \\nSpecifically, certain e-liquid products are sold or distributed on the website to consumers in the United States with the statements: “99.9% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA,” and “The 100% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA”: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L. Because these statements or representations on the website are directed to consumers and convey, mislead, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA, they are in violation of section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act.\\n \\nMisbranded Tobacco Products\\n \\nFDA has also determined that certain e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)). Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its “labeling is false or misleading in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is false or misleading in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\n                                    \\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\n \\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are available for purchase on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are sold on the website under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, “WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco and drug products into compliance with the FD&C Act. \\n \\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco and drug products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.

       "1  Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated animal food facility located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” lot code #10/02/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, lot code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer’s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.

       "2  Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  “Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\n \\n2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\nSuch foods are “Reportable Foods.”  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please see FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within 15 business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again.  More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.

       "3  On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a complaint (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\n \\nAny substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:\\n \\nWe note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. For more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nYour written response should be sent to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the attention of Janice L. King, Compliance Officer.  If you have questions, you may contact Ms. King at (843) 746-2990, Ext. 16.\\n \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nIngrid A.

       "4  Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe found the following significant deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” critical control point your critical limit of “(b)(4)” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A.

tradename of the antiobesity drug product in europe. using the tradename of the drug product acomplia and including an image of the acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\n \\nadditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your erimonabant hellocig eliquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your ecialis hellocig eliquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type pde inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in viagra™, an fdaapproved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction ed. tadalafil is also a pde inhibitor and is the active ingredient in cialis™, another fdaapproved prescription drug used to treat ed. the presence

ecialis hellocig eliquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nunder section a of the fdc act  u.s.c. § a, a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  according to section n of the fdc act  u.s.c. § n, in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account among other things not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” the labeling for your ecialis hellocig eliquid and erimonabant hellocig eliquid fail to declare that the products contain the pde inhibitors listed above. the use of pde inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. the undeclared pde inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. for example, pde inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. the failure to disclose the presence of the pde inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. therefore, ecialis hellocig eliquid and erimonabant hellocig eliquid are misbranded drugs under section a of the fdc act  u.s.c. § a. \\n \\necialis hellocig eliquid and erimonabant hellocig eliquid contain one or more pde inhibitors. all pde inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by fda are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. therefore, ecialis hellocig eliquid and erimonabant hellocig eliquid are prescription drugs as defined in section ba of the fdc act  u.s.c. § ba, because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\ntherefore, ecialis hellocig eliquid and erimonabant hellocig eliquid are misbranded under section f of the fdc act  u.s.c. § f, because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses. “adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended,  cfr ..  because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section ba of the fdc act  u.s.c. § ba,  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. fdaapproved prescription drugs which bear their fdaapproved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson  cfr .c and .. because no fdaapproved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section f of the fdc act. consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section f of the fdc act  u.s.c. § f.\\n \\nthe undeclared pde inhibitors in ecialis hellocig eliquid and erimonabant hellocig eliquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section f of the fdc act  u.s.c. § f in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   as previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of pde inhibitors. consumers who use ecialis hellocig eliquid and erimonabant hellocig eliquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug

and ,  of your nonlicensed medicated animal food facility located at  s, main street, ainsworth, ne. during this inspection fda documented significant deviations from the current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulations for nonlicensed medicated animal food manufacturers, title  code of federal regulations cfr, part   cfr . these cgmps deviations cause your nonmedicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section acii of the act  u.s.c. acii and section ab of the act  u.s.c. § ab, respectively. you may find the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act and fda’s regulations through links on the fda’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nin addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be nonmedicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the nebraska department of agriculture’s nda surveillance sampling. specifically\\n.    nda sampled and analyzed your “sandhills select horse feed g” lot code   and found monensin at . parts per million or  gramston. monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n.    nda sampled and analyzed your “b” lot code   and found chlortetracycline at  gramston. although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “b” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\n \\nadulterated animal food  medicated feed cgmp violations\\n \\nfda’s inspection in may  documented significant deviations of the cgmp regulations for nonlicensed medicated animal food manufacturers  cfr part . we acknowledge your written response dated june , ; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n.    you failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by  cfr. .. you were notified by nda  that  your “sandhills select horse feed”, lot code  , was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, b that your “b” lot code   was contaminated with chlortetracycline, this caused these nonmedicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. during our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\n \\nyour june ,  written response discusses your corrective actions for the sandhills select horse feed and the b nonmedicated animal foods which nda sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. however, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. these results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. for example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. in addition, the presence of drugs in a nonmedicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a nonmedicated batch. your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n

fda and the minnesota department of agriculture mda conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at  th street ne, gilman, minnesota, on july , , and , . this inspection was conducted in response to a livestock food registry lfr event, received by fda on  july , , which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom horse blend  manufactured on june , . fda found through laboratory analysis that your custom horse blend  contained monensin. monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n \\nthe presence of monensin in your horse blend  causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section aai of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act the act,  u.s.c. § baai.  as a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section acii of the act,  u.s.c. § acii. in addition, our inspection revealed violations of the current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements for medicated feed, which cause your nonmedicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section acii of the act,  u.s.c. § acii, and section ab of the act,  u.s.c. § ab, respectively.\\n \\nmedicated feed cgmp requirements are in title , code of federal regulations, part   cfr .  you may find the act and fda’s regulations through links on the fda’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nadulterated animal food\\n \\nduring our july  inspection we collected a sample of your nonmedicated custom horse blend , manufactured on june , , for drug analysis. the sample analysis found  parts per million ppm of monensin in your product. monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  as a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin  “do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,”  cfr .d.  therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.\\n \\nmedicated feed cgmp violations\\n \\nthe violations of the medicated feed cgmp regulations for nonlicensed medicated animal food manufacturers  cfr . observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following\\n \\n.    you failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and nonmedicated feeds,  cfr .. \\n \\nyour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and nonmedicated feeds. on june , , you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing b monensin. after the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. the two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a nonmedicated custom horse blend , were both found to contain monensin. your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure  “b flush is required for all medicated feed.”  you failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. as a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. this is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\n \\nadditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive buildup on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. excessive buildup and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carryover of drugs from one batch to another because buildup containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\n \\n.    you failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment if not for own use.  the records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution,  cfr ..\\n \\nyour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. during a review of your records on june , , your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  this is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\n \\n.    you failed to identify and store bulk type b medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained,  cfr ..\\n \\nour investigator observed several open bulk bays where type b medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nto date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the form fda, inspectional observations.\\n \\nconclusion\\n \\nthe above is not intended to be an allinclusive list of violations. as a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the act and its implementing regulations. you should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nsection  of the act  u.s.c. § j authorizes fda to assess and collect fees to cover fda’s costs for certain activities, including reinspectionrelated costs. a reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially

incurred in connection with fda’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees,  u.s.c. § jab. for a domestic facility, fda will assess and collect fees for reinspectionrelated costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. the inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the act. accordingly, fda may assess fees to cover any reinspectionrelated costs.\\n \\nba\\n \\nthe reportable food registry was established by section  of the food and drug administration amendments act of  pub. l.  to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by fda to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  it requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\nsuch foods are “reportable foods.”  the responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section a of the act,  u.s.c. § fd, for a food facility that is required to register under section a, at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a

       "3    on january , , the u.s. food and drug administration “fda” or “we” received a complaint “january  complaint” from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from salmonella septicemia confirmed by necropsy after the kittens ate your blue ridge beef brb kitten grind for cats product. in response to this complaint, on january , , fda investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of brb kitten grind, lot   ga , manufactured on november ,  fda sample  . this sample was analyzed by an fda laboratory and was positive for salmonella and l. monocytogenes. the fda laboratory also conducted whole genome sequencing analysis of sample   and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. this analysis revealed that the salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the salmonella isolated from brb kitten grind for cats, fda sample  , demonstrating that your brb kitten grind product was the source of illness.  \\n \\nalso, in response to the january  complaint, fda conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at  maddox road, eatonton, ga, on march  through , . during our inspection, fda collected an unopened package of brb complete, lot   b, manufactured on january ,  fda sample  . this sample was analyzed by an fda laboratory and was positive for salmonella and l. monocytogenes.  we also collected an unopened finished product sample of brb kitten grind for cats, lot   b, manufactured on february ,  fda sample  .   the sample was analyzed by an fda laboratory and was found positive for salmonella.  \\n \\nthe presence of salmonella, l. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food andor humans handling the pet food. therefore, as discussed above, your blue ridge beef kitten grind for cats and blue ridge beef complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section a of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act the act in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section a of the act  u.s.c. § a.  you may find the act and fda’s regulations through links on fda’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nafter fda notified you of the sample results, you recalled brb kitten grind, lot   ga  and brb complete, lot   ga . the fda designated these recalls as class i, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death see  cfr .m and  cfr .. you reported that you placed brb kitten grind for cats, lot   ga , on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\n \\nprior samples\\n \\nwe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with l. monocytogenes, salmonella and escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes andor facility. specifically, in november , fda received two consumer complaints regarding your products brb kitten grind and brb for dogs. we collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\n \\nproduct\\nfda sample number\\ndate collected\\npositive results\\nbrb kitten grind\\n\\n\\nsalmonella, escherichia

this recall as class i, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death see  cfr .m and  cfr ..\\n \\npublic health impact of pathogens\\n \\nunlike other pet foods which are heattreated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a readytoeat product. raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. it is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\n \\nsalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. pets like dogs and cats may get salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. people may also contract salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer shortterm symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. fda considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the salmonella, as expressed in fda’s compliance policy guide cpg salmonella in food for animals, cpg sec.., \\n \\nlisteria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. it can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes lifethreatening illness called listeriosis. pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immunecompromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer shortterm symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nantimicrobial treatments\\n \\nduring the fda inspection in march , you indicated that your firm uses a b during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\n \\nany substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by fda, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe gras among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section s of the fdc act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. there is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of b in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the b is gras under the conditions of intended use i.e., as an antimicrobial agent. \\n \\nwe received your written response, dated march , , following the fda inspection. in that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of b. however, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact gras under their intended conditions of use.\\n \\nwe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foottraffic entrances, and testhold procedures for final products. these corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\n \\nconclusion\\n \\nthe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an allinclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. you are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. it is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and fda regulations. you should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nin addition to the above violations, we have the following comments\\n \\nwe note that your facility is subject to current good manufacturing practice requirements cgmps for food for animals  cfr part , subpart b, which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with cgmps may be considered adulterated  cfr .a  iii and sections a and  of the fdc act.  please see fda’s guidance for industry  , current good manufacturing practice requirements for food for animals, at \\n \\nstarting on september , , you must also comply with hazard analysis and riskbased preventive controls requirements  cfr part , subparts c and e, unless an exemption applies  cfr ..  to comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual pcqi must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  the pcqi, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  we note that salmonella and listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. for more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance guidance for industry  , hazard analysis and riskbased preventive controls for food for animals, at \\n \\nwithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. if you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. if you believe that your products are not in violation of the fdc act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nyour

       "4    dear mr. paramesawa sornsong\\n \\nthe u.s. food and drug administration fda conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, natural sea product co., ltd., located at , moo ; tambol bangyapak, muang samut sakhon, samut sakhon, samut sakhon, , thailand on may  and , .  that inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood hazard analysis and critical control point haccp regulation, title , code of federal regulations, part   cfr . that inspection resulted in fda’s issuance of an fda, inspectional observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. we acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on may , , which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised haccp plan entitled “dried fish” that covers your shelfstable, vacuumpackaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nin accordance with  cfr .g, failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a haccp plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of part  renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of section a of the federal food, drug, and cosmetic act the act,  u.s.c. § a. accordingly, your shelfstable, vacuumpackaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. you may find the act, the seafood haccp regulation and the th edition of the fish and fishery products hazards and controls guidance the hazards guide through links on fdas home page at www.fda.gov. the hazards guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at \\n \\nwe found the following significant deviations  \\n \\n.    you must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a haccp plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with  cfr .a and c. a food safety hazard is defined in  cfr .f as any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption. however, your firm’s revised haccp plan provided with your may , , email entitled “dried fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins e.g., ciguatera toxin, which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\n \\n.    you must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a haccp plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with  cfr .a and c. a critical control point ccp is defined in  cfr .b as a point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels. however, your firm’s revised haccp plan entitled “dried fish” does not list the following ccps that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. specifically,\\n \\na.  a b ccp that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin histamine formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held b. fda recommends you include a refrigerated storage ccp to ensure that products held for extended time periods inprocess are stored continuously at a temperature of .° c or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\n \\nb.  a b critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin histamine formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. fda recommends you include salting and curing ccps to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin histamine formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant staphylococcus aureus s. aureus organism identified in your haccp plan. fda recommends that the fish are continuously held at .° c or below for the entire duration of the saltingcuring step.\\n \\n.    you must have a haccp plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with  cfr .c. a critical limit is defined in  cfr .c as the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard. however, your firm’s revised haccp plan provided with your may , , email for “dried fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control s. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin histamine formation. specifically, at the “b” critical control point your critical limit of “b” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  fda recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin histamine and s. aureus until a safe water activity . or below is achieved in the fish flesh.   however, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “b” ccp list processing temperatures of b – b°c. although b°c is sufficient to control s. aureusgrowthtoxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin histamine formation for the duration of the bstep. fda recommends temperatures of °c or higher to inhibitprevent histamine formation during extended dryingdehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. at your current processing temperatures of b – b °c, fda recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of . or less within  hours. additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  this would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. in addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. if this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture relative humidity. \\n \\nyou should respond in writing within fifteen  working days from your receipt of this letter. your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. more specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised haccp plan, five  consecutive days of completed monitoring records i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of  production date codes of products to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood haccp regulation. if you cannot complete all corrections within  days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. if you believe you have complied with fda regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nif you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. for instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under section a of the act  u.s.c. § a, including placing them on detention without physical examination dwpe. fda’s dwpe is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the united states may be detained without physical examination upon entry. dwpe information may be conveyed in fda’s import alerts. for your information, an example of an import alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood haccp regulation is import alert . this alert can be found on fda’s web site at \\n \\nthis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. you are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood haccp and the current good manufacturing practice hazard analysis, and riskbased preventive controls for human food regulation cgmp  pc rule, title , code of federal regulations, part   cfr part  subpart b.  you also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nadditionally, section  of the act  u.s.c. § j authorizes fda to assess and collect fees to cover fda’s costs for certain activities, including reinspectionrelated costs.  a reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. reinspectionrelated costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with fda’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees  u.s.c. § jab. for a foreign facility, fda will assess and collect fees for reinspectionrelated costs from the u.s. agent for the foreign facility. the inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the act. accordingly, fda may assess fees to cover any reinspectionrelated costs. please

Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquids violates section 301(tt) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are directed to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA. \\n \\nAdditionally, FDA has determined that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)) and misbranded under sections 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). \\n \\nSection 301(tt) Violation\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquid products violates section 301(tt) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:\\n \\n“[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation directed to consumers with respect to a tobacco product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would mislead consumers into believing, that—\\n(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\\n(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be safe for use by consumers;\\n(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use by consumers; or\\n(4)   the product is safe or less harmful by virtue of—\\n(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or\\n(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration…”\\n \\nSpecifically, certain e-liquid products are sold or distributed on the website to consumers in the United States with the statements: “99.9% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA,” and “The 100% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA”: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L. Because these statements or representations on the website are directed to consumers and convey, mislead, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA, they are in violation of section 301(tt) of the FD&amp;C Act.\\n \\nMisbranded Tobacco Products\\n \\nFDA has also determined that certain e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)). Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its “labeling is false or misleading in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&amp;C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is false or misleading in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\n                                    \\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\n \\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are available for purchase on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are sold on the website under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, “WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco and drug products into compliance with the FD&amp;C Act. \\n \\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco and drug products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.

       "      <td>Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated animal food facility located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” lot code #10/02/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, lot code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer’s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&amp;C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  Please see our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations from occurring again. More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease send your written response to Danial S. Hutchison, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 8050 Marshall Dr., Suite 205, Lenexa, KS 66214. If you have any questions about this letter, please contact Mr. Hutchison at 913-495-5154.\\n \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nCheryl A.

       "      <td>Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  “Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\n \\n2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\nSuch foods are “Reportable Foods.”  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please see FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within 15 business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again.  More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections cannot be completed within 15 business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease send your written response to Dianna C. Sonnenburg, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, at 250 Marquette Ave, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55401. If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Mrs. Sonnenburg at (612) 758-7125.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a complaint (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\n \\nAny substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&amp;C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:\\n \\nWe note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  Please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. For more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&amp;C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nYour written response should be sent to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the attention of Janice L. King, Compliance Officer.  If you have questions, you may contact Ms. King at (843) 746-2990, Ext. 16.\\n \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nIngrid A. Zambrana\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration                                                                                                               \\nDistrict Director, Atlanta District (GA-NC-SC)\\nProgram Division Director, Office of Human and Animal Foods- Division III East\\nOffice of Regulatory Affairs\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe found the following significant deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” critical control point your critical limit of “(b)(4)” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (&lt;0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP &amp; PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact Marco Esteves via email at marco.esteves@fda.hhs.gov.

       "0  The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewedhttp://www.hellocig.com and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquids violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are directed to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA. \\n \\nAdditionally, FDA has determined that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)) and misbranded under sections 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). \\n \\nSection 301(tt) Violation\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquid products violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:\\n \\n“[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation directed to consumers with respect to a tobacco product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would mislead consumers into believing, that—\\n(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\\n(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be safe for use by consumers;\\n(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use by consumers; or\\n(4)   the product is safe or less harmful by virtue of—\\n(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or\\n(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration…”\\n \\nSpecifically, certain e-liquid products are sold or distributed on the website to consumers in the United States with the statements: “99.9% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA,” and “The 100% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA”: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L. Because these statements or representations on the website are directed to consumers and convey, mislead, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA, they are in violation of section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act.\\n \\nMisbranded Tobacco Products\\n \\nFDA has also determined that certain e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)). Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its “labeling is false or misleading in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is false or misleading in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\n                                    \\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\n \\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are available for purchase on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are sold on the website under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, “WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.

       "1  Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated animal food facility located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” lot code #10/02/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, lot code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer’s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  Please see our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations from occurring again. More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease send your written response to Danial S.

       "2  Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  “Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\n \\n2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\nSuch foods are “Reportable Foods.”  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please see FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within 15 business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again.  More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.

       "3  On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a complaint (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\n \\nAny substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:\\n \\nWe note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. For more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nYour written response should be sent to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the attention of Janice L. King, Compliance Officer.  If you have questions, you may contact Ms. King at (843) 746-2990, Ext. 16.\\n \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nIngrid A.

       "4  Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe found the following significant deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” critical control point your critical limit of “(b)(4)” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A.

Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its “labeling is false or misleading in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&amp;C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is false or misleading in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\n                                    \\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\n \\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are available for purchase on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are sold on the website under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, “WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco and drug products into compliance with the FD&amp;C Act. \\n \\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco and drug products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to ensure full compliance with the FD&amp;C Act may result in FDA initiating further action without notice, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, criminal prosecution, seizure, and/or injunction. Please note that adulterated and misbranded tobacco products offered for import into the United States are subject to detention and refusal of admission.\\n \\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your corrective actions, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&amp;C Act.

       "      <td>Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated animal food facility located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” lot code #10/02/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, lot code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer’s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&amp;C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  Please see our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations from occurring again. More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease send your written response to Danial S. Hutchison, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 8050 Marshall Dr., Suite 205, Lenexa, KS 66214. If you have any questions about this letter, please contact Mr. Hutchison at 913-495-5154.\\n \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nCheryl A. Bigham\\nProgram Division Director\\nOffice of Human and Animal Foods Division II West\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  “Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\n \\n2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\nSuch foods are “Reportable Foods.”  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please see FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within 15 business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again.  More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections cannot be completed within 15 business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease send your written response to Dianna C. Sonnenburg, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, at 250 Marquette Ave, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55401. If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Mrs. Sonnenburg at (612) 758-7125.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a complaint (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\n \\nAny substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&amp;C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:\\n \\nWe note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  Please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. For more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&amp;C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nYour written response should be sent to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the attention of Janice L.

       "      <td>Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe found the following significant deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” critical control point your critical limit of “(b)(4)” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (&lt;0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP &amp; PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A. If you have any questions regarding this letter, you may contact Marco Esteves via email at marco.esteves@fda.hhs.gov. Please reference #CMS 562272 on any submissions and within the subject line of any emails to us. \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nWilliam A.

       "0  The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewedhttp://www.hellocig.com and determined that the e-liquid products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to consumers in the United States. Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquids violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are directed to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA. \\n \\nAdditionally, FDA has determined that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)) and misbranded under sections 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). \\n \\nSection 301(tt) Violation\\n \\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http://www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquid products violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:\\n \\n“[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation directed to consumers with respect to a tobacco product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would mislead consumers into believing, that—\\n(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\\n(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be safe for use by consumers;\\n(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use by consumers; or\\n(4)   the product is safe or less harmful by virtue of—\\n(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or\\n(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration…”\\n \\nSpecifically, certain e-liquid products are sold or distributed on the website to consumers in the United States with the statements: “99.9% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA,” and “The 100% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA”: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L. Because these statements or representations on the website are directed to consumers and convey, mislead, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA, they are in violation of section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act.\\n \\nMisbranded Tobacco Products\\n \\nFDA has also determined that certain e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)). Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its “labeling is false or misleading in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is false or misleading in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\n                                    \\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\n \\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.

Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are sold on the website under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, “WOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising “is misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco and drug products into compliance with the FD&C Act. \\n \\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco and drug products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.

       "1  Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated animal food facility located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” lot code #10/02/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, lot code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” lot code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer’s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  Please see our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations from occurring again. More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease send your written response to Danial S.

       "2  Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on the FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  “Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\n \\n2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\nSuch foods are “Reportable Foods.”  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please see FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should respond in writing within 15 business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again.  More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.

       "3  On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a complaint (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\n \\nAny substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your “active kill agents” during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\n \\nIn addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:\\n \\nWe note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please see FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. For more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nYour written response should be sent to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the attention of Janice L. King, Compliance Officer.  If you have questions, you may contact Ms. King at (843) 746-2990, Ext. 16.\\n \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nIngrid A.

       "4  Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe found the following significant deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan entitled “Dried Fish” does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” critical control point your critical limit of “(b)(4)” alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A.

E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are [PV]available[E] for [PV]purchase[E] on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of [NV]claims[E] for these products [PV]observed[E] on the [PV]website[E] that [PV]establish[E] the intended [PV]uses[E] of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis [PV]bottle[E] and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are [PV]sold[E] on the [PV]website[E] under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a [PV]partially[E] undressed [PV]couple[E] embracing. The [PV]caption[E] states, “WOOOOW, Have you [PV]tried[E] our E-Cialis? It is [PV]amazing[E] LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis [PV]bottle[E] and tablets next to the product on your [PV]website[E] [PV]suggests[E] that this product is intended to [PV]improve[E] [PV]sexual[E] [PV]capacity[E] for [PV]men[E] who [NV]suffer[E] from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your [PV]website[E] [PV]suggests[E] that the product is intended to [PV]treat[E] obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] erectile [NV]dysfunction[E] (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 201(p) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as [PV]safe[E] and [NV]effective[E] for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent [NV]approval[E] of an application filed in accordance with [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the [PV]subject[E] of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current [PV]marketing[E] of these products violates [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs [PV]described[E] above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder [PV]section[E] 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is [NV]false[E] or [NV]misleading[E] in any particular.  According to [PV]section[E] 201(n) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in [PV]determining[E] whether the labeling or [PV]advertising[E] “is misleading, there shall be [NV]taken[E] into [PV]account[E] (among other things) not only representations [PV]made[E] or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or [PV]advertising[E] [NV]fails[E] to reveal facts [PV]material[E] in the [PV]light[E] of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [NV]fail[E] to declare that the products [PV]contain[E] the PDE-5 inhibitors [PV]listed[E] above. The [PV]use[E] of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with [PV]significant[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]issues[E] and the [NV]risk[E] of [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may [PV]pose[E] [PV]serious[E] [PV]health[E] [NV]risks[E] because consumers with underlying medical [NV]issues[E] may [PV]take[E] the products without [PV]knowing[E] that they can [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]harm[E] or interact in [NV]dangerous[E] [PV]ways[E] with other [NV]drugs[E] they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates [PV]found[E] in some prescription [NV]drugs[E] (such as nitroglycerin) and can [NV]lower[E] [NV]blood[E] [NV]pressure[E] to [NV]dangerous[E] levels. Consumers with diabetes, [PV]high[E] [NV]blood[E] pressure, or [PV]heart[E] [NV]disease[E] often [PV]take[E] nitrates. The [NV]failure[E] to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling [NV]false[E] or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded [NV]drugs[E] under [PV]section[E] 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contain[E] [PV]one[E] or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for [PV]marketing[E] by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to [PV]use[E] under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription [NV]drugs[E] as defined in [PV]section[E] 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in [PV]light[E] of their [NV]toxicity[E] or [PV]potential[E] for [NV]harmful[E] effects, the [PV]method[E] of their use, or the collateral [PV]measures[E] necessary for their use, they are not [PV]safe[E] for [PV]use[E] except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can [PV]use[E] a drug [PV]safely[E] and for the [PV]purposes[E] for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription [NV]drugs[E] can only be [NV]used[E] [PV]safely[E] at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, [PV]section[E] 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for [PV]use[E] cannot be [PV]written[E] so that a layperson can [PV]use[E] them [PV]safely[E] for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription [NV]drugs[E] which [PV]bear[E] their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for [PV]use[E] by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act. Consequently, their labeling [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also [PV]cause[E] these products to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is [PV]potential[E] for [NV]adverse[E] [PV]events[E] associated with the [PV]use[E] of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who [PV]use[E] E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be [NV]unaware[E] of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and [PV]placed[E] at [NV]risk[E] for their associated [NV]adverse[E] events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] discussed in this [PV]letter[E] do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] that are referenced above, as [PV]well[E] as [NV]violations[E] that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and [PV]take[E] any necessary [PV]actions[E] to bring your [NV]tobacco[E] and drug products into compliance with the FD&amp;C Act. \\n \\nIt is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [NV]tobacco[E] and drug products and all related labeling and/or [PV]advertising[E] on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, [PV]social[E] networking, or search [PV]engine[E] websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&amp;C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.

       "      <td>Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented [PV]significant[E] deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may [PV]find[E] the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA’s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on [PV]two[E] occasions you manufactured and distributed [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] that was intended to be non-medicated but was [PV]determined[E] to [PV]contain[E] [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) [NV]surveillance[E] sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” [PV]lot[E] code #10/02/2017 and [PV]found[E] monensin at 4.2 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] adverse [NV]health[E] consequences or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” [PV]lot[E] code #11/22/2017 and [PV]found[E] chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for [PV]use[E] in [NV]swine[E] food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to [PV]contain[E] any [PV]animal[E] drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented [PV]significant[E] deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We [PV]acknowledge[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] dated June 5, 2018; however, your [PV]response[E] does not adequately [PV]address[E] the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to adequately investigate and implement corrective [PV]actions[E] when laboratory assays of drug [PV]components[E] indicated that medicated [PV]feed[E] was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such [PV]records[E] on the premises for [PV]one[E] year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, [PV]lot[E] code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” [PV]lot[E] code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no [PV]records[E] were provided of an investigation or corrective [PV]actions[E] regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] discusses your corrective [PV]actions[E] for the Sandhills Select Horse [PV]feed[E] and the (b)(4) non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] which NDA sampled and [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] new [PV]animal[E] drugs. Your [PV]response[E] stated that you [PV]sent[E] retained [PV]samples[E] for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and [PV]trained[E] employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your [PV]response[E] does not indicate you have investigated the [PV]cause[E] of these [PV]two[E] lab results. These [PV]results[E] could have a [PV]variety[E] of [NV]causes[E] from [PV]situations[E] other than carryover due to [NV]improper[E] sequencing. For example, carryover may [PV]occur[E] because no flush was implemented, or an [PV]ineffective[E] flush occurred. In addition, the presence of [NV]drugs[E] in a non-medicated [PV]feed[E] may [PV]result[E] from an operator or [PV]machine[E] [NV]error[E] that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective [PV]actions[E] do not [PV]identify[E] the root [PV]cause[E] of the incidents and do not [PV]address[E] the other [PV]possible[E] [PV]ways[E] the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated [PV]feeds[E] intended for [PV]use[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of medicated [PV]feeds[E] to [PV]aid[E] in assuring the identity, strength, [PV]quality[E] and [PV]purity[E] of these drug [PV]sources[E] as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we [PV]found[E] multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, [NV]used[E] to further [PV]manufacture[E] [PV]animal[E] food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the [PV]following[E] new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] were not [PV]recorded[E] in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted [PV]additional[E] [PV]training[E] to [PV]ensure[E] all new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] are included on your drug records. You included the SOP [PV]signed[E] by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the [PV]effectiveness[E] of your SOP and [PV]training[E] at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the incidents [PV]listed[E] above, in June 2018 your [PV]firm[E] bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for [PV]internal[E] use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently [PV]fed[E] to your customer’s [PV]cattle[E] and resulted in the [PV]death[E] of four cows and [NV]illness[E] of [PV]two[E] cows. We [PV]acknowledge[E] that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and [PV]submitted[E] a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued [NV]lack[E] of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the FD&amp;C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B. These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  For more information, [PV]please[E] [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now [PV]subject[E] to the [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.  Please [PV]see[E] our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) business [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific [PV]steps[E] you are [PV]taking[E] or have [NV]taken[E] to [NV]correct[E] these violations, including an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these violations, or similar [NV]violations[E] from occurring again. More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to [PV]address[E] systemic problems) your [PV]firm[E] has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections will [PV]occur[E] over time, [PV]please[E] [PV]include[E] a timetable for [PV]implementation[E] of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease [PV]send[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] to Danial S. Hutchison, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 8050 Marshall Dr., Suite 205, Lenexa, KS 66214.

       "      <td>Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial [PV]feed[E] mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in [PV]response[E] to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the [PV]death[E] of five horses after consuming your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA [PV]found[E] through laboratory analysis that your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 [PV]contained[E] monensin. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 [NV]causes[E] it to be [NV]unsafe[E] because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug was not [NV]used[E] in conformance with the drug [NV]approval[E] as outlined in [PV]section[E] 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed [NV]violations[E] of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and [PV]section[E] 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA’s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a [PV]sample[E] of your non-medicated [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The [PV]sample[E] analysis [PV]found[E] 143 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for [PV]use[E] in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may [PV]experience[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequence[E] such as tachycardia, ataxia, or [NV]gross[E] [NV]lesions[E] in [NV]cardiac[E] and [NV]skeletal[E] [PV]muscles[E] after consuming monensin.  As a result, the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug [NV]approval[E] for monensin requires the [PV]following[E] [NV]caution[E] statement to be [PV]placed[E] on all formulations [PV]containing[E] monensin:  “Do not [NV]allow[E] horses or other equines access to [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] a [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is [NV]unsafe[E] and adulterated because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] and its labeling, distribution, holding, and [PV]use[E] does not conform to the approved [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] of the medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) [PV]observed[E] during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]use[E] adequate procedures for all equipment [NV]used[E] in the [PV]production[E] and distribution of medicated [NV]feeds[E] to avoid [NV]unsafe[E] [NV]contamination[E] of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing [NV]operations[E] are [NV]inadequate[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that your medicated [PV]feed[E] does not [NV]contaminate[E] other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a [PV]custom[E] [PV]cattle[E] mix [PV]containing[E] (b)(4) (monensin). After the [PV]manufacture[E] of this medicated feed, it does not appear [PV]steps[E] were [NV]taken[E] to either flush or [NV]clean[E] equipment. The [PV]two[E] batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin [PV]custom[E] steer mix and a non-medicated [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985, were both [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] monensin. Your [PV]facility[E] notes on the batching [PV]records[E] the [PV]following[E] procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]document[E] that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your [PV]facility[E] cannot [PV]ensure[E] your flushing procedure was [PV]followed[E] after [PV]manufacture[E] of a medicated feed. This is a repeat [NV]violation[E] from the previous inspection where it was [PV]noted[E] that your [PV]firm[E] is not documenting on the [PV]production[E] [PV]record[E] when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was [PV]noted[E] during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal [PV]ribbon[E] within the drum, on the horizontal [PV]ribbon[E] in [PV]front[E] of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was [PV]noted[E] that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule [PV]established[E] for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and [NV]lack[E] of cleaning may [PV]contribute[E] to the carry-over of [NV]drugs[E] from [PV]one[E] batch to another because build-up [PV]containing[E] [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] on equipment [PV]can[E] dislodge during [PV]manufacturing[E] of subsequent batches and [NV]contaminate[E] the batch with the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug. \\n \\n2.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] formula, production, and distribution [PV]records[E] to [PV]identify[E] the formulation. Records must be maintained which [PV]identify[E] the formulation, [PV]date[E] of mixing, and [PV]date[E] of shipment (if not for own use).  The [PV]records[E] shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated [PV]feed[E] that have been distributed.  Such [PV]records[E] shall be retained on the premises for [PV]one[E] year [PV]following[E] the [PV]date[E] of [NV]last[E] distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated [PV]feed[E] batching [PV]records[E] [PV]include[E] a [PV]space[E] to [PV]record[E] the drug name, [PV]lot[E] number, and [PV]pounds[E] per batch. During a [PV]review[E] of your [PV]records[E] on June 4, 2018, your [PV]production[E] [PV]records[E] did not have any entries for the drug name, drug [PV]lot[E] number, and amount of drug [NV]used[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat [NV]violation[E] from the previous inspection where it was [PV]noted[E] that your [PV]firm[E] [NV]failed[E] to [PV]document[E] drug [PV]lot[E] numbers on the [PV]production[E] [PV]record[E] when [PV]manufacturing[E] medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]identify[E] and [PV]store[E] bulk Type B medicated [NV]feeds[E] in a [PV]manner[E] such that their identity, strength, quality, and [PV]purity[E] will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator [PV]observed[E] several [PV]open[E] bulk bays where Type B medicated [NV]feeds[E] including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the [PV]agency[E] has not received any [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] from your [PV]firm[E] [PV]regarding[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] non-compliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] non-compliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was [PV]established[E] by [PV]section[E] 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to [PV]provide[E] a [PV]reliable[E] mechanism to [PV]track[E] patterns of adulteration in [PV]food[E] to [PV]support[E] efforts by FDA to target limited inspection [PV]resources[E] to protect the [PV]public[E] health.  It requires a [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] to file a [NV]report[E] when there is a [PV]reasonable[E] [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, an article of [PV]food[E] will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to humans or animals.\\nSuch [PV]foods[E] are “Reportable Foods.”  The [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] is the [PV]person[E] who submits the registration under [PV]section[E] 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] that is required to register under [PV]section[E] 415(a), at which such article of [PV]food[E] is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to [PV]submit[E] a required [NV]report[E] about a reportable [PV]food[E] is a prohibited act under [PV]section[E] 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [PV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal [PV]food[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are [PV]subject[E] to specific CGMPs, such as medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as [PV]well[E] as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, [PV]please[E] [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now [PV]subject[E] to the [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate [PV]identified[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please [PV]see[E] FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within 15 business [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific [PV]steps[E] you are [PV]taking[E] or have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] these violations, including an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these [NV]violations[E] or similar [NV]violations[E] from occurring again.  More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to [PV]address[E] systemic problems) your [PV]firm[E] has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will [PV]occur[E] over time, [PV]please[E] [PV]include[E] a timetable for [PV]implementation[E] of those activities.  If corrections cannot be completed within 15 business days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease [PV]send[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] to Dianna C. Sonnenburg, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, at 250 Marquette Ave, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55401.

       "      <td>On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a [NV]complaint[E] (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the [NV]death[E] of [PV]two[E] kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens [PV]ate[E] your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In [PV]response[E] to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic [PV]samples[E] collected during the necropsy of [PV]one[E] of the kittens that died after [PV]eating[E] your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and [NV]small[E] [NV]intestine[E] was identical to the Salmonella [NV]isolated[E] from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the [PV]source[E] of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in [PV]response[E] to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]facility[E] at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product [PV]sample[E] of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]found[E] [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] in [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] may [PV]result[E] in [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] to [PV]animals[E] consuming the [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] and/or humans [PV]handling[E] the [PV]pet[E] food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they [PV]bear[E] or [PV]contain[E] a [NV]poisonous[E] or deleterious [PV]substance[E] which may render such products injurious to health.  The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce of an adulterated [PV]food[E] is a [NV]violation[E] of [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the [PV]sample[E] results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you [PV]placed[E] BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on [PV]hold[E] [NV]pending[E] [PV]sample[E] [PV]results[E] and no portion of the [PV]lot[E] was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your [PV]firm[E] has had prior instances of [NV]contamination[E] with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent [NV]problems[E] with your [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]processes[E] and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received [PV]two[E] consumer [NV]complaints[E] [PV]regarding[E] your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened [PV]samples[E] of your products in [PV]response[E] to these [NV]complaints[E] and the [PV]table[E] below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we [PV]sent[E] you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the [PV]results[E] of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the [PV]lots[E] that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products [PV]present[E] [PV]particular[E] hazards to human and [PV]animal[E] [NV]health[E] because they [PV]contain[E] uncooked [PV]animal[E] proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] is [PV]produced[E] with minimal [PV]processing[E] and is intended to be [PV]handled[E] by humans and [PV]fed[E] to [PV]animals[E] without cooking, that is, without [PV]measures[E] routinely [NV]used[E] to [NV]kill[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] pathogens. It is therefore [PV]essential[E] that your [PV]firm[E] has [PV]measures[E] in [PV]place[E] to prevent and [NV]reduce[E] pathogenic [NV]contamination[E] of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] and sometimes [NV]fatal[E] infections in both humans and animals. Pets [PV]like[E] [PV]dogs[E] and [PV]cats[E] may [PV]get[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]eating[E] contaminated [PV]pet[E] foods. People may also [PV]contract[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]handling[E] these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] or having [PV]contact[E] with infected [PV]pets[E] or their feces. Infections can be especially [PV]serious[E] in [PV]young[E] children, elderly people, and others with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems. Healthy individuals, as [PV]well[E] as pets, may [NV]suffer[E] short-term symptoms such as [NV]severe[E] diarrhea, [NV]bloody[E] diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial [PV]heat[E] [PV]step[E] or other commercial process to [NV]kill[E] the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute [PV]danger[E] to human and [PV]animal[E] health. It can proliferate in [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] can [PV]lead[E] to a severe, sometimes life-threatening [NV]illness[E] [PV]called[E] listeriosis. Pregnant [PV]women[E] and [PV]people[E] with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems, including [PV]young[E] children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more [NV]vulnerable[E] to these infections. Healthy [PV]individuals[E] as [PV]well[E] as [PV]pets[E] may [NV]suffer[E] short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your [PV]firm[E] [PV]uses[E] a (b)(4) during [PV]manufacturing[E] to [NV]reduce[E] the presence of pathogens in your [PV]pet[E] foods. \\n \\nAny [PV]substance[E] that is [PV]reasonably[E] expected to [PV]become[E] a [PV]component[E] of [PV]food[E] is a [PV]food[E] additive that is [PV]subject[E] to premarket [PV]approval[E] by FDA, unless the [PV]substance[E] is generally [PV]recognized[E] as [PV]safe[E] (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific [PV]training[E] and [PV]experience[E] to evaluate its [PV]safety[E] under the [NV]conditions[E] of its intended use, [PV]meets[E] [PV]one[E] of the other exclusions from the [PV]food[E] additive definition in [PV]section[E] 201(s) of the FD&amp;C Act, or is otherwise permitted for [PV]use[E] in [PV]animal[E] food. There is no [PV]food[E] additive regulation that authorizes [PV]use[E] of (b)(4) in [PV]animal[E] food, and the agency is [PV]unaware[E] of any data or [PV]information[E] to [NV]demonstrate[E] that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the [NV]conditions[E] of intended [PV]use[E] (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your [PV]written[E] response, dated March 29, 2018, [PV]following[E] the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the [PV]use[E] of your “active [NV]kill[E] agents” during manufacturing, including the [PV]use[E] of (b)(4). However, we are [NV]unable[E] to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your [PV]response[E] lacks [PV]important[E] specific [PV]details[E] [PV]showing[E] evidence of the [PV]safety[E] of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products. Also, your [PV]response[E] does not address whether you have [NV]determined[E] these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended [NV]conditions[E] of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and [PV]processing[E] practices. Some of these changes [PV]include[E] but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the [PV]facility[E] from [PV]outside[E] environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the [PV]use[E] of sanitizing [PV]foot[E] baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective [PV]actions[E] will be evaluated during our next inspection of your [PV]manufacturing[E] facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this [PV]letter[E] are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of [NV]violations[E] that exist in connection with your product(s). You are [PV]responsible[E] for investigating and [PV]determining[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] [PV]identified[E] above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [PV]firm[E] complies with all requirements of [NV]federal[E] law and FDA regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the above violations, we have the [PV]following[E] comments:\\n \\nWe note that your [PV]facility[E] is [PV]subject[E] to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for [PV]food[E] for [PV]animals[E] (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B), which [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&amp;C Act).  Please [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are [PV]known[E] and [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards in [NV]raw[E] [PV]meat[E] [PV]pet[E] food. For more [PV]information[E] on this topic, you may [PV]refer[E] to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receipt of this letter, [PV]please[E] notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] that you have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] violations. Include an [PV]explanation[E] of each [PV]step[E] being [NV]taken[E] to prevent the recurrence of violations, as [PV]well[E] as copies of related documentation. If you cannot [PV]complete[E] the corrective [PV]action[E] within fifteen [PV]working[E] days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] within which you will [PV]complete[E] the correction. If you [PV]believe[E] that your products are not in [NV]violation[E] of the FD&amp;C Act, [PV]include[E] your reasoning and any supporting [PV]information[E] for our consideration.\\n \\nYour [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] should be [PV]sent[E] to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the [PV]attention[E] of Janice L.

       "      <td>Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your [PV]seafood[E] [PV]processing[E] facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed [PV]serious[E] [NV]violations[E] of the [PV]seafood[E] Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, [PV]listing[E] the deviations [PV]found[E] at your [PV]firm[E] at the conclusion of the inspection. We [PV]acknowledge[E] receipt of your [PV]response[E] received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a [PV]cover[E] [PV]letter[E] outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” that [PV]covers[E] your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried [PV]fish[E] products, and photos of corrective [PV]actions[E] [PV]made[E] to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your [PV]response[E] is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), [NV]failure[E] of a [PV]seafood[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facility[E] to have and implement a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that complies with this [PV]section[E] or otherwise [NV]operate[E] in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the [PV]fish[E] or fishery products adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried [PV]fish[E] products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or [PV]held[E] under [NV]conditions[E] whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may [PV]find[E] the Act, the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through [PV]links[E] on FDA's [PV]home[E] [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations [PV]regarding[E] identification and control of [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] for your [PV]fish[E] and fishery products, can be [PV]found[E] on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe [PV]found[E] the [PV]following[E] [PV]significant[E] deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a [NV]hazard[E] analysis for each [PV]kind[E] of [PV]fish[E] and fishery product that you [PV]produce[E] to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may [PV]cause[E] a [PV]food[E] to be [NV]unsafe[E] for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of [NV]natural[E] toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in [PV]yellow[E] stripe trevally [NV]caught[E] in [PV]tropical[E] and subtropical [PV]waters[E] that your [PV]firm[E] needs to control as the [PV]primary[E] processor receiving the [PV]fish[E] directly from the [PV]harvest[E] vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a [PV]food[E] [PV]process[E] at which control can be [PV]applied[E] and a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] can as a [PV]result[E] be prevented, eliminated, or [NV]reduced[E] to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]following[E] CCPs that are necessary to control each of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in your dried scombroid species [PV]fish[E] while [PV]held[E] (b)(4). FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] a refrigerated [PV]storage[E] CCP to [PV]ensure[E] that products [PV]held[E] for extended [PV]time[E] periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by [PV]ice[E] throughout the [PV]storage[E] period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation. FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] salting and curing CCPs to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]fish[E] are [PV]held[E] at [PV]appropriate[E] temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation (i.e., including the [PV]potential[E] for growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation from the [PV]salt[E] tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism [PV]identified[E] in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the [PV]fish[E] are continuously [PV]held[E] at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A [NV]critical[E] limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum [PV]value[E] to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to prevent, eliminate, or [NV]reduce[E] to an acceptable [PV]level[E] the occurrence of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” [PV]lists[E] [NV]critical[E] limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] your [NV]critical[E] limit of “(b)(4)” [NV]alone[E] is not adequate to control the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards.  FDA recommends that you also [PV]include[E] corresponding [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] or temperature or a combination of both at this [PV]step[E] to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a [PV]safe[E] [PV]water[E] activity (&lt;0.85 or below) is achieved in the [PV]fish[E] flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP [PV]list[E] [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is [PV]sufficient[E] to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is [NV]inadequate[E] to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration [PV]time[E] periods when there is no [NV]critical[E] limit for time. At your current [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you [PV]establish[E] through a scientific study, the [PV]processing[E] parameters that will [PV]allow[E] the [PV]fish[E] [NV]flesh[E] to achieve a [PV]water[E] activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures [PV]currently[E] [PV]listed[E] in your monitoring procedures should be [PV]listed[E] as [NV]critical[E] limits if they are [NV]critical[E] drying factors.  This would also [PV]apply[E] to any [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] that you [PV]establish[E] as [NV]critical[E] to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your [PV]firm[E] is monitoring the moisture [NV]conditions[E] in the solar dome. If this is a [NV]critical[E] factor, you should [PV]consider[E] [PV]establishing[E] a [NV]critical[E] limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific things you are doing to [PV]correct[E] these violations. More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation and [PV]information[E] that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) [PV]consecutive[E] [PV]days[E] of completed monitoring [PV]records[E] (i.e., [PV]complete[E] [PV]sets[E] of monitoring [PV]records[E] for the [PV]production[E] of 5 [PV]production[E] [PV]date[E] codes of products) to [PV]demonstrate[E] [PV]implementation[E] of the plan, and any [PV]additional[E] [PV]information[E] that you [PV]wish[E] to supply that provides assurance of your [PV]intent[E] to fully comply now and in the [PV]future[E] with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation. If you cannot [PV]complete[E] all corrections within 15 days, you should [PV]explain[E] the [PV]reason[E] for your [NV]delay[E] and state when you will [PV]correct[E] any [PV]remaining[E] violations. If you [PV]believe[E] you have complied with FDA regulations, [PV]include[E] your [PV]reasoning[E] and any [PV]supporting[E] [PV]information[E] for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not [PV]respond[E] or if we [PV]find[E] your [PV]response[E] inadequate, we may [PV]take[E] further action. For instance, we may [PV]take[E] further [PV]action[E] to [NV]refuse[E] admission of your imported [PV]fish[E] or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including [PV]placing[E] them on [NV]detention[E] without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products [PV]offered[E] for [PV]import[E] into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE [PV]information[E] may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an [PV]example[E] of an Import Alert that conveys [PV]information[E] specific to [PV]foreign[E] [PV]firms[E] that are not in compliance with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This [PV]alert[E] can be [PV]found[E] on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis [PV]letter[E] may not [PV]list[E] all the deviations at your facility. You are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring that your [PV]processing[E] [PV]plant[E] [PV]operates[E] in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP &amp; PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to [PV]use[E] procedures to prevent further [NV]violations[E] of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a [PV]foreign[E] facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the [PV]foreign[E] facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any re-inspection-related costs. Please [PV]consider[E] providing a copy of this [PV]letter[E] to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease [PV]send[E] your [PV]reply[E] to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A.

Certain [NV]tobacco[E] products, including e-liquids, are [PV]subject[E] to FDA jurisdiction under [PV]section[E] 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)).\\n \\nFDA has [PV]determined[E] that statements or representations [PV]made[E] on the [PV]website[E] http://www.hellocig.com regarding [PV]certain[E] e-liquids violates [PV]section[E] 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are [PV]directed[E] to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would [NV]mislead[E] consumers into [PV]believing[E] that the [NV]tobacco[E] products are approved by FDA. \\n \\nAdditionally, FDA has [PV]determined[E] that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new [NV]drugs[E] in [NV]violation[E] of [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 355(a)) and misbranded under [PV]sections[E] 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). \\n \\nSection 301(tt) Violation\\n \\nFDA has [PV]determined[E] that statements or representations [PV]made[E] on the [PV]website[E] http://www.hellocig.com regarding [PV]certain[E] e-liquid products violates [PV]section[E] 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:\\n \\n“[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation [PV]directed[E] to consumers with [PV]respect[E] to a [NV]tobacco[E] product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would [NV]mislead[E] consumers into believing, that—\\n(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\\n(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be [PV]safe[E] for [PV]use[E] by consumers;\\n(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for [PV]use[E] by consumers; or\\n(4)   the product is [PV]safe[E] or less [NV]harmful[E] by [PV]virtue[E] of—\\n(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or\\n(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements [PV]set[E] by the Food and Drug Administration…”\\n \\nSpecifically, [PV]certain[E] e-liquid products are [PV]sold[E] or distributed on the [PV]website[E] to consumers in the United States with the statements: “99.9% [PV]pure[E] [NV]nicotine[E] is FDA approved product with FDA,” and “The 100% [PV]pure[E] [NV]nicotine[E] is FDA approved product with FDA”: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L. Because these statements or representations on the [PV]website[E] are [PV]directed[E] to consumers and convey, mislead, or would [NV]mislead[E] consumers into [PV]believing[E] that the [NV]tobacco[E] products are approved by FDA, they are in [NV]violation[E] of [PV]section[E] 301(tt) of the FD&C Act.\\n \\nMisbranded Tobacco Products\\n \\nFDA has also [PV]determined[E] that [PV]certain[E] e-liquid products are misbranded under [PV]section[E] 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(1)) and/or [PV]section[E] 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(A)). Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a [NV]tobacco[E] product is misbranded if its “labeling is [NV]false[E] or [NV]misleading[E] in any particular.” Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&C Act provides that a [NV]tobacco[E] product distributed or [PV]offered[E] for [PV]sale[E] in any State is misbranded if its “advertising is [NV]false[E] or [NV]misleading[E] in any particular.” These e-liquid products are misbranded under [PV]section[E] 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and/or [PV]section[E] 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act as their labeling or [PV]advertising[E] is [NV]false[E] or [NV]misleading[E] because it [PV]makes[E] the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\n                                    \\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\n \\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are “drugs” as defined by [PV]section[E] 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, and/or under [PV]section[E] 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are [PV]available[E] for [PV]purchase[E] on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of [NV]claims[E] for these products [PV]observed[E] on the [PV]website[E] that [PV]establish[E] the intended [PV]uses[E] of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of a Cialis [PV]bottle[E] and tablets. \\n \\n“E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid” with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\n \\n“E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” and “E-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid” are [PV]sold[E] on the [PV]website[E] under the “HC Healthcare Flavor” category.\\n \\nAn advertisement for “E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid” on Twitter and Tumblr state “Cialis” with an image of the product and a [PV]partially[E] undressed [PV]couple[E] embracing. The [PV]caption[E] states, “WOOOOW, Have you [PV]tried[E] our E-Cialis? It is [PV]amazing[E] LOL Check out: http://www.hellocig.com/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml”\\n \\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis [PV]bottle[E] and tablets next to the product on your [PV]website[E] [PV]suggests[E] that this product is intended to [PV]improve[E] [PV]sexual[E] [PV]capacity[E] for [PV]men[E] who [NV]suffer[E] from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your [PV]website[E] [PV]suggests[E] that the product is intended to [PV]treat[E] obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] erectile [NV]dysfunction[E] (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as [PV]safe[E] and [NV]effective[E] for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent [NV]approval[E] of an application filed in accordance with [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the [PV]subject[E] of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current [PV]marketing[E] of these products violates [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs [PV]described[E] above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder [PV]section[E] 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is [NV]false[E] or [NV]misleading[E] in any particular.  According to [PV]section[E] 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in [PV]determining[E] whether the labeling or [PV]advertising[E] “is misleading, there shall be [NV]taken[E] into [PV]account[E] (among other things) not only representations [PV]made[E] or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or [PV]advertising[E] [NV]fails[E] to reveal facts [PV]material[E] in the [PV]light[E] of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [NV]fail[E] to declare that the products [PV]contain[E] the PDE-5 inhibitors [PV]listed[E] above. The [PV]use[E] of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with [PV]significant[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]issues[E] and the [NV]risk[E] of [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may [PV]pose[E] [PV]serious[E] [PV]health[E] [NV]risks[E] because consumers with underlying medical [NV]issues[E] may [PV]take[E] the products without [PV]knowing[E] that they can [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]harm[E] or interact in [NV]dangerous[E] [PV]ways[E] with other [NV]drugs[E] they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates [PV]found[E] in some prescription [NV]drugs[E] (such as nitroglycerin) and can [NV]lower[E] [NV]blood[E] [NV]pressure[E] to [NV]dangerous[E] levels. Consumers with diabetes, [PV]high[E] [NV]blood[E] pressure, or [PV]heart[E] [NV]disease[E] often [PV]take[E] nitrates. The [NV]failure[E] to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling [NV]false[E] or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded [NV]drugs[E] under [PV]section[E] 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contain[E] [PV]one[E] or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for [PV]marketing[E] by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to [PV]use[E] under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription [NV]drugs[E] as defined in [PV]section[E] 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in [PV]light[E] of their [NV]toxicity[E] or [PV]potential[E] for [NV]harmful[E] effects, the [PV]method[E] of their use, or the collateral [PV]measures[E] necessary for their use, they are not [PV]safe[E] for [PV]use[E] except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can [PV]use[E] a drug [PV]safely[E] and for the [PV]purposes[E] for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription [NV]drugs[E] can only be [NV]used[E] [PV]safely[E] at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, [PV]section[E] 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for [PV]use[E] cannot be [PV]written[E] so that a layperson can [PV]use[E] them [PV]safely[E] for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription [NV]drugs[E] which [PV]bear[E] their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for [PV]use[E] by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Consequently, their labeling [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also [PV]cause[E] these products to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is [PV]potential[E] for [NV]adverse[E] [PV]events[E] associated with the [PV]use[E] of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who [PV]use[E] E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be [NV]unaware[E] of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and [PV]placed[E] at [NV]risk[E] for their associated [NV]adverse[E] events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] discussed in this [PV]letter[E] do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] that are referenced above, as [PV]well[E] as [NV]violations[E] that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and [PV]take[E] any necessary [PV]actions[E] to bring your [NV]tobacco[E] and drug products into compliance with the FD&C Act. \\n \\nIt is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [NV]tobacco[E] and drug products and all related labeling and/or [PV]advertising[E] on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, [PV]social[E] networking, or search [PV]engine[E] websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations.

       "1  Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented [PV]significant[E] deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may [PV]find[E] the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA’s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on [PV]two[E] occasions you manufactured and distributed [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] that was intended to be non-medicated but was [PV]determined[E] to [PV]contain[E] [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) [NV]surveillance[E] sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” [PV]lot[E] code #10/02/2017 and [PV]found[E] monensin at 4.2 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] adverse [NV]health[E] consequences or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” [PV]lot[E] code #11/22/2017 and [PV]found[E] chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for [PV]use[E] in [NV]swine[E] food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to [PV]contain[E] any [PV]animal[E] drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented [PV]significant[E] deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We [PV]acknowledge[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] dated June 5, 2018; however, your [PV]response[E] does not adequately [PV]address[E] the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to adequately investigate and implement corrective [PV]actions[E] when laboratory assays of drug [PV]components[E] indicated that medicated [PV]feed[E] was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such [PV]records[E] on the premises for [PV]one[E] year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, [PV]lot[E] code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” [PV]lot[E] code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no [PV]records[E] were provided of an investigation or corrective [PV]actions[E] regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] discusses your corrective [PV]actions[E] for the Sandhills Select Horse [PV]feed[E] and the (b)(4) non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] which NDA sampled and [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] new [PV]animal[E] drugs. Your [PV]response[E] stated that you [PV]sent[E] retained [PV]samples[E] for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and [PV]trained[E] employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your [PV]response[E] does not indicate you have investigated the [PV]cause[E] of these [PV]two[E] lab results. These [PV]results[E] could have a [PV]variety[E] of [NV]causes[E] from [PV]situations[E] other than carryover due to [NV]improper[E] sequencing. For example, carryover may [PV]occur[E] because no flush was implemented, or an [PV]ineffective[E] flush occurred. In addition, the presence of [NV]drugs[E] in a non-medicated [PV]feed[E] may [PV]result[E] from an operator or [PV]machine[E] [NV]error[E] that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective [PV]actions[E] do not [PV]identify[E] the root [PV]cause[E] of the incidents and do not [PV]address[E] the other [PV]possible[E] [PV]ways[E] the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated [PV]feeds[E] intended for [PV]use[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of medicated [PV]feeds[E] to [PV]aid[E] in assuring the identity, strength, [PV]quality[E] and [PV]purity[E] of these drug [PV]sources[E] as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we [PV]found[E] multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, [NV]used[E] to further [PV]manufacture[E] [PV]animal[E] food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the [PV]following[E] new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] were not [PV]recorded[E] in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted [PV]additional[E] [PV]training[E] to [PV]ensure[E] all new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] are included on your drug records. You included the SOP [PV]signed[E] by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the [PV]effectiveness[E] of your SOP and [PV]training[E] at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the incidents [PV]listed[E] above, in June 2018 your [PV]firm[E] bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for [PV]internal[E] use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently [PV]fed[E] to your customer’s [PV]cattle[E] and resulted in the [PV]death[E] of four cows and [NV]illness[E] of [PV]two[E] cows. We [PV]acknowledge[E] that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and [PV]submitted[E] a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued [NV]lack[E] of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B. These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, [PV]please[E] [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now [PV]subject[E] to the [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.

       "2  Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial [PV]feed[E] mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in [PV]response[E] to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the [PV]death[E] of five horses after consuming your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA [PV]found[E] through laboratory analysis that your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 [PV]contained[E] monensin. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 [NV]causes[E] it to be [NV]unsafe[E] because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug was not [NV]used[E] in conformance with the drug [NV]approval[E] as outlined in [PV]section[E] 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed [NV]violations[E] of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and [PV]section[E] 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA’s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a [PV]sample[E] of your non-medicated [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The [PV]sample[E] analysis [PV]found[E] 143 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for [PV]use[E] in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may [PV]experience[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequence[E] such as tachycardia, ataxia, or [NV]gross[E] [NV]lesions[E] in [NV]cardiac[E] and [NV]skeletal[E] [PV]muscles[E] after consuming monensin.  As a result, the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug [NV]approval[E] for monensin requires the [PV]following[E] [NV]caution[E] statement to be [PV]placed[E] on all formulations [PV]containing[E] monensin:  “Do not [NV]allow[E] horses or other equines access to [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] a [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is [NV]unsafe[E] and adulterated because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] and its labeling, distribution, holding, and [PV]use[E] does not conform to the approved [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] of the medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) [PV]observed[E] during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]use[E] adequate procedures for all equipment [NV]used[E] in the [PV]production[E] and distribution of medicated [NV]feeds[E] to avoid [NV]unsafe[E] [NV]contamination[E] of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing [NV]operations[E] are [NV]inadequate[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that your medicated [PV]feed[E] does not [NV]contaminate[E] other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a [PV]custom[E] [PV]cattle[E] mix [PV]containing[E] (b)(4) (monensin). After the [PV]manufacture[E] of this medicated feed, it does not appear [PV]steps[E] were [NV]taken[E] to either flush or [NV]clean[E] equipment. The [PV]two[E] batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin [PV]custom[E] steer mix and a non-medicated [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985, were both [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] monensin. Your [PV]facility[E] notes on the batching [PV]records[E] the [PV]following[E] procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]document[E] that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your [PV]facility[E] cannot [PV]ensure[E] your flushing procedure was [PV]followed[E] after [PV]manufacture[E] of a medicated feed. This is a repeat [NV]violation[E] from the previous inspection where it was [PV]noted[E] that your [PV]firm[E] is not documenting on the [PV]production[E] [PV]record[E] when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was [PV]noted[E] during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal [PV]ribbon[E] within the drum, on the horizontal [PV]ribbon[E] in [PV]front[E] of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was [PV]noted[E] that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule [PV]established[E] for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and [NV]lack[E] of cleaning may [PV]contribute[E] to the carry-over of [NV]drugs[E] from [PV]one[E] batch to another because build-up [PV]containing[E] [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] on equipment [PV]can[E] dislodge during [PV]manufacturing[E] of subsequent batches and [NV]contaminate[E] the batch with the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug. \\n \\n2.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] formula, production, and distribution [PV]records[E] to [PV]identify[E] the formulation. Records must be maintained which [PV]identify[E] the formulation, [PV]date[E] of mixing, and [PV]date[E] of shipment (if not for own use).  The [PV]records[E] shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated [PV]feed[E] that have been distributed.  Such [PV]records[E] shall be retained on the premises for [PV]one[E] year [PV]following[E] the [PV]date[E] of [NV]last[E] distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated [PV]feed[E] batching [PV]records[E] [PV]include[E] a [PV]space[E] to [PV]record[E] the drug name, [PV]lot[E] number, and [PV]pounds[E] per batch. During a [PV]review[E] of your [PV]records[E] on June 4, 2018, your [PV]production[E] [PV]records[E] did not have any entries for the drug name, drug [PV]lot[E] number, and amount of drug [NV]used[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat [NV]violation[E] from the previous inspection where it was [PV]noted[E] that your [PV]firm[E] [NV]failed[E] to [PV]document[E] drug [PV]lot[E] numbers on the [PV]production[E] [PV]record[E] when [PV]manufacturing[E] medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]identify[E] and [PV]store[E] bulk Type B medicated [NV]feeds[E] in a [PV]manner[E] such that their identity, strength, quality, and [PV]purity[E] will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator [PV]observed[E] several [PV]open[E] bulk bays where Type B medicated [NV]feeds[E] including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the [PV]agency[E] has not received any [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] from your [PV]firm[E] [PV]regarding[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] non-compliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] non-compliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was [PV]established[E] by [PV]section[E] 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to [PV]provide[E] a [PV]reliable[E] mechanism to [PV]track[E] patterns of adulteration in [PV]food[E] to [PV]support[E] efforts by FDA to target limited inspection [PV]resources[E] to protect the [PV]public[E] health.  It requires a [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] to file a [NV]report[E] when there is a [PV]reasonable[E] [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, an article of [PV]food[E] will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to humans or animals.\\nSuch [PV]foods[E] are “Reportable Foods.”  The [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] is the [PV]person[E] who submits the registration under [PV]section[E] 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] that is required to register under [PV]section[E] 415(a), at which such article of [PV]food[E] is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to [PV]submit[E] a required [NV]report[E] about a reportable [PV]food[E] is a prohibited act under [PV]section[E] 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [PV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal [PV]food[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are [PV]subject[E] to specific CGMPs, such as medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as [PV]well[E] as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, [PV]please[E] [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now [PV]subject[E] to the [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate [PV]identified[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please [PV]see[E] FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within 15 business [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific [PV]steps[E] you are [PV]taking[E] or have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] these violations, including an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these [NV]violations[E] or similar [NV]violations[E] from occurring again.  More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to [PV]address[E] systemic problems) your [PV]firm[E] has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections will [PV]occur[E] over time, [PV]please[E] [PV]include[E] a timetable for [PV]implementation[E] of those activities.

       "3  On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a [NV]complaint[E] (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the [NV]death[E] of [PV]two[E] kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens [PV]ate[E] your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In [PV]response[E] to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic [PV]samples[E] collected during the necropsy of [PV]one[E] of the kittens that died after [PV]eating[E] your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and [NV]small[E] [NV]intestine[E] was identical to the Salmonella [NV]isolated[E] from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the [PV]source[E] of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in [PV]response[E] to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]facility[E] at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product [PV]sample[E] of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]found[E] [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] in [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] may [PV]result[E] in [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] to [PV]animals[E] consuming the [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] and/or humans [PV]handling[E] the [PV]pet[E] food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they [PV]bear[E] or [PV]contain[E] a [NV]poisonous[E] or deleterious [PV]substance[E] which may render such products injurious to health.  The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce of an adulterated [PV]food[E] is a [NV]violation[E] of [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the [PV]sample[E] results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you [PV]placed[E] BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on [PV]hold[E] [NV]pending[E] [PV]sample[E] [PV]results[E] and no portion of the [PV]lot[E] was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your [PV]firm[E] has had prior instances of [NV]contamination[E] with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent [NV]problems[E] with your [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]processes[E] and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received [PV]two[E] consumer [NV]complaints[E] [PV]regarding[E] your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened [PV]samples[E] of your products in [PV]response[E] to these [NV]complaints[E] and the [PV]table[E] below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we [PV]sent[E] you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the [PV]results[E] of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the [PV]lots[E] that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products [PV]present[E] [PV]particular[E] hazards to human and [PV]animal[E] [NV]health[E] because they [PV]contain[E] uncooked [PV]animal[E] proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] is [PV]produced[E] with minimal [PV]processing[E] and is intended to be [PV]handled[E] by humans and [PV]fed[E] to [PV]animals[E] without cooking, that is, without [PV]measures[E] routinely [NV]used[E] to [NV]kill[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] pathogens. It is therefore [PV]essential[E] that your [PV]firm[E] has [PV]measures[E] in [PV]place[E] to prevent and [NV]reduce[E] pathogenic [NV]contamination[E] of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] and sometimes [NV]fatal[E] infections in both humans and animals. Pets [PV]like[E] [PV]dogs[E] and [PV]cats[E] may [PV]get[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]eating[E] contaminated [PV]pet[E] foods. People may also [PV]contract[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]handling[E] these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] or having [PV]contact[E] with infected [PV]pets[E] or their feces. Infections can be especially [PV]serious[E] in [PV]young[E] children, elderly people, and others with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems. Healthy individuals, as [PV]well[E] as pets, may [NV]suffer[E] short-term symptoms such as [NV]severe[E] diarrhea, [NV]bloody[E] diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial [PV]heat[E] [PV]step[E] or other commercial process to [NV]kill[E] the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute [PV]danger[E] to human and [PV]animal[E] health. It can proliferate in [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] can [PV]lead[E] to a severe, sometimes life-threatening [NV]illness[E] [PV]called[E] listeriosis. Pregnant [PV]women[E] and [PV]people[E] with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems, including [PV]young[E] children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more [NV]vulnerable[E] to these infections. Healthy [PV]individuals[E] as [PV]well[E] as [PV]pets[E] may [NV]suffer[E] short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your [PV]firm[E] [PV]uses[E] a (b)(4) during [PV]manufacturing[E] to [NV]reduce[E] the presence of pathogens in your [PV]pet[E] foods. \\n \\nAny [PV]substance[E] that is [PV]reasonably[E] expected to [PV]become[E] a [PV]component[E] of [PV]food[E] is a [PV]food[E] additive that is [PV]subject[E] to premarket [PV]approval[E] by FDA, unless the [PV]substance[E] is generally [PV]recognized[E] as [PV]safe[E] (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific [PV]training[E] and [PV]experience[E] to evaluate its [PV]safety[E] under the [NV]conditions[E] of its intended use, [PV]meets[E] [PV]one[E] of the other exclusions from the [PV]food[E] additive definition in [PV]section[E] 201(s) of the FD&C Act, or is otherwise permitted for [PV]use[E] in [PV]animal[E] food. There is no [PV]food[E] additive regulation that authorizes [PV]use[E] of (b)(4) in [PV]animal[E] food, and the agency is [PV]unaware[E] of any data or [PV]information[E] to [NV]demonstrate[E] that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the [NV]conditions[E] of intended [PV]use[E] (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your [PV]written[E] response, dated March 29, 2018, [PV]following[E] the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the [PV]use[E] of your “active [NV]kill[E] agents” during manufacturing, including the [PV]use[E] of (b)(4). However, we are [NV]unable[E] to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your [PV]response[E] lacks [PV]important[E] specific [PV]details[E] [PV]showing[E] evidence of the [PV]safety[E] of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products. Also, your [PV]response[E] does not address whether you have [NV]determined[E] these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended [NV]conditions[E] of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and [PV]processing[E] practices. Some of these changes [PV]include[E] but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the [PV]facility[E] from [PV]outside[E] environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the [PV]use[E] of sanitizing [PV]foot[E] baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective [PV]actions[E] will be evaluated during our next inspection of your [PV]manufacturing[E] facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this [PV]letter[E] are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of [NV]violations[E] that exist in connection with your product(s). You are [PV]responsible[E] for investigating and [PV]determining[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] [PV]identified[E] above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [PV]firm[E] complies with all requirements of [NV]federal[E] law and FDA regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the above violations, we have the [PV]following[E] comments:\\n \\nWe note that your [PV]facility[E] is [PV]subject[E] to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for [PV]food[E] for [PV]animals[E] (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B), which [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are [PV]known[E] and [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards in [NV]raw[E] [PV]meat[E] [PV]pet[E] food. For more [PV]information[E] on this topic, you may [PV]refer[E] to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receipt of this letter, [PV]please[E] notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] that you have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] violations.

       "4  Dear Mr. Paramesawa Sornsong:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your [PV]seafood[E] [PV]processing[E] facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed [PV]serious[E] [NV]violations[E] of the [PV]seafood[E] Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA’s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, [PV]listing[E] the deviations [PV]found[E] at your [PV]firm[E] at the conclusion of the inspection. We [PV]acknowledge[E] receipt of your [PV]response[E] received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a [PV]cover[E] [PV]letter[E] outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” that [PV]covers[E] your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried [PV]fish[E] products, and photos of corrective [PV]actions[E] [PV]made[E] to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your [PV]response[E] is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), [NV]failure[E] of a [PV]seafood[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facility[E] to have and implement a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that complies with this [PV]section[E] or otherwise [NV]operate[E] in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the [PV]fish[E] or fishery products adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried [PV]fish[E] products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or [PV]held[E] under [NV]conditions[E] whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may [PV]find[E] the Act, the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through [PV]links[E] on FDA's [PV]home[E] [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations [PV]regarding[E] identification and control of [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] for your [PV]fish[E] and fishery products, can be [PV]found[E] on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe [PV]found[E] the [PV]following[E] [PV]significant[E] deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a [NV]hazard[E] analysis for each [PV]kind[E] of [PV]fish[E] and fishery product that you [PV]produce[E] to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \"any biological, chemical, or physical property that may [PV]cause[E] a [PV]food[E] to be [NV]unsafe[E] for human consumption.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of [NV]natural[E] toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in [PV]yellow[E] stripe trevally [NV]caught[E] in [PV]tropical[E] and subtropical [PV]waters[E] that your [PV]firm[E] needs to control as the [PV]primary[E] processor receiving the [PV]fish[E] directly from the [PV]harvest[E] vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \"point, step, or procedure in a [PV]food[E] [PV]process[E] at which control can be [PV]applied[E] and a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] can as a [PV]result[E] be prevented, eliminated, or [NV]reduced[E] to acceptable levels.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]following[E] CCPs that are necessary to control each of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in your dried scombroid species [PV]fish[E] while [PV]held[E] (b)(4). FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] a refrigerated [PV]storage[E] CCP to [PV]ensure[E] that products [PV]held[E] for extended [PV]time[E] periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by [PV]ice[E] throughout the [PV]storage[E] period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation. FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] salting and curing CCPs to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]fish[E] are [PV]held[E] at [PV]appropriate[E] temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation (i.e., including the [PV]potential[E] for growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation from the [PV]salt[E] tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism [PV]identified[E] in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the [PV]fish[E] are continuously [PV]held[E] at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A [NV]critical[E] limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \"the maximum or minimum [PV]value[E] to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to prevent, eliminate, or [NV]reduce[E] to an acceptable [PV]level[E] the occurrence of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazard.\" However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” [PV]lists[E] [NV]critical[E] limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] your [NV]critical[E] limit of “(b)(4)” [NV]alone[E] is not adequate to control the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards.  FDA recommends that you also [PV]include[E] corresponding [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] or temperature or a combination of both at this [PV]step[E] to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a [PV]safe[E] [PV]water[E] activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the [PV]fish[E] flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP [PV]list[E] [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is [PV]sufficient[E] to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is [NV]inadequate[E] to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration [PV]time[E] periods when there is no [NV]critical[E] limit for time. At your current [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you [PV]establish[E] through a scientific study, the [PV]processing[E] parameters that will [PV]allow[E] the [PV]fish[E] [NV]flesh[E] to achieve a [PV]water[E] activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures [PV]currently[E] [PV]listed[E] in your monitoring procedures should be [PV]listed[E] as [NV]critical[E] limits if they are [NV]critical[E] drying factors.  This would also [PV]apply[E] to any [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] that you [PV]establish[E] as [NV]critical[E] to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your [PV]firm[E] is monitoring the moisture [NV]conditions[E] in the solar dome. If this is a [NV]critical[E] factor, you should [PV]consider[E] [PV]establishing[E] a [NV]critical[E] limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific things you are doing to [PV]correct[E] these violations. More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation and [PV]information[E] that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) [PV]consecutive[E] [PV]days[E] of completed monitoring [PV]records[E] (i.e., [PV]complete[E] [PV]sets[E] of monitoring [PV]records[E] for the [PV]production[E] of 5 [PV]production[E] [PV]date[E] codes of products) to [PV]demonstrate[E] [PV]implementation[E] of the plan, and any [PV]additional[E] [PV]information[E] that you [PV]wish[E] to supply that provides assurance of your [PV]intent[E] to fully comply now and in the [PV]future[E] with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation. If you cannot [PV]complete[E] all corrections within 15 days, you should [PV]explain[E] the [PV]reason[E] for your [NV]delay[E] and state when you will [PV]correct[E] any [PV]remaining[E] violations. If you [PV]believe[E] you have complied with FDA regulations, [PV]include[E] your [PV]reasoning[E] and any [PV]supporting[E] [PV]information[E] for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not [PV]respond[E] or if we [PV]find[E] your [PV]response[E] inadequate, we may [PV]take[E] further action. For instance, we may [PV]take[E] further [PV]action[E] to [NV]refuse[E] admission of your imported [PV]fish[E] or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including [PV]placing[E] them on [NV]detention[E] without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products [PV]offered[E] for [PV]import[E] into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE [PV]information[E] may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an [PV]example[E] of an Import Alert that conveys [PV]information[E] specific to [PV]foreign[E] [PV]firms[E] that are not in compliance with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This [PV]alert[E] can be [PV]found[E] on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis [PV]letter[E] may not [PV]list[E] all the deviations at your facility. You are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring that your [PV]processing[E] [PV]plant[E] [PV]operates[E] in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to [PV]use[E] procedures to prevent further [NV]violations[E] of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a [PV]foreign[E] facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the [PV]foreign[E] facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any re-inspection-related costs. Please [PV]consider[E] providing a copy of this [PV]letter[E] to your U.S. Agent.\\n \\nPlease [PV]send[E] your [PV]reply[E] to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A.

Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis [PV]bottle[E] and tablets next to the product on your [PV]website[E] [PV]suggests[E] that this product is intended to [PV]improve[E] [PV]sexual[E] [PV]capacity[E] for [PV]men[E] who [NV]suffer[E] from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your [PV]website[E] [PV]suggests[E] that the product is intended to [PV]treat[E] obesity. \\n \\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra™, an FDA-approved prescription drug [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] erectile [NV]dysfunction[E] (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis™, another FDA-approved prescription drug [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, and/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body.\\n \\nThese products are “new drugs” within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as [PV]safe[E] and [NV]effective[E] for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent [NV]approval[E] of an application filed in accordance with [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the [PV]subject[E] of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current [PV]marketing[E] of these products violates [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C § 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(d)).  \\n \\nMisbranded Drugs\\n \\nAs [PV]described[E] above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contained[E] undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\n \\nUnder [PV]section[E] 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is [NV]false[E] or [NV]misleading[E] in any particular.  According to [PV]section[E] 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n)), in [PV]determining[E] whether the labeling or [PV]advertising[E] “is misleading, there shall be [NV]taken[E] into [PV]account[E] (among other things) not only representations [PV]made[E] or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or [PV]advertising[E] [NV]fails[E] to reveal facts [PV]material[E] in the [PV]light[E] of such representations . . ..” The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [NV]fail[E] to declare that the products [PV]contain[E] the PDE-5 inhibitors [PV]listed[E] above. The [PV]use[E] of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with [PV]significant[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]issues[E] and the [NV]risk[E] of [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may [PV]pose[E] [PV]serious[E] [PV]health[E] [NV]risks[E] because consumers with underlying medical [NV]issues[E] may [PV]take[E] the products without [PV]knowing[E] that they can [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]harm[E] or interact in [NV]dangerous[E] [PV]ways[E] with other [NV]drugs[E] they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates [PV]found[E] in some prescription [NV]drugs[E] (such as nitroglycerin) and can [NV]lower[E] [NV]blood[E] [NV]pressure[E] to [NV]dangerous[E] levels. Consumers with diabetes, [PV]high[E] [NV]blood[E] pressure, or [PV]heart[E] [NV]disease[E] often [PV]take[E] nitrates. The [NV]failure[E] to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products’ labeling [NV]false[E] or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded [NV]drugs[E] under [PV]section[E] 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(a)). \\n \\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid [PV]contain[E] [PV]one[E] or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for [PV]marketing[E] by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to [PV]use[E] under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription [NV]drugs[E] as defined in [PV]section[E] 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in [PV]light[E] of their [NV]toxicity[E] or [PV]potential[E] for [NV]harmful[E] effects, the [PV]method[E] of their use, or the collateral [PV]measures[E] necessary for their use, they are not [PV]safe[E] for [PV]use[E] except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\n \\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)), because their labeling [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can [PV]use[E] a drug [PV]safely[E] and for the [PV]purposes[E] for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription [NV]drugs[E] can only be [NV]used[E] [PV]safely[E] at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, [PV]section[E] 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for [PV]use[E] cannot be [PV]written[E] so that a layperson can [PV]use[E] them [PV]safely[E] for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription [NV]drugs[E] which [PV]bear[E] their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for [PV]use[E] by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Consequently, their labeling [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)).\\n \\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also [PV]cause[E] these products to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)) in that the products’ labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is [PV]potential[E] for [NV]adverse[E] [PV]events[E] associated with the [PV]use[E] of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who [PV]use[E] E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be [NV]unaware[E] of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and [PV]placed[E] at [NV]risk[E] for their associated [NV]adverse[E] events. \\n \\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 331(a)). \\n \\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] discussed in this [PV]letter[E] do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.

       "1     Cindie Kesler, CEO/President\\nFarmers/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\n224 S Main Street\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\n \\n \\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\n \\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented [PV]significant[E] deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may [PV]find[E] the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA’s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nIn addition, on [PV]two[E] occasions you manufactured and distributed [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] that was intended to be non-medicated but was [PV]determined[E] to [PV]contain[E] [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture’s (NDA) [NV]surveillance[E] sampling. Specifically:\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00” [PV]lot[E] code #10/02/2017 and [PV]found[E] monensin at 4.2 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] or 4 grams/ton. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] adverse [NV]health[E] consequences or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your “(b)(4)” [PV]lot[E] code #11/22/2017 and [PV]found[E] chlortetracycline at 57 grams/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for [PV]use[E] in [NV]swine[E] food, your “(b)(4)” is not labeled to [PV]contain[E] any [PV]animal[E] drugs.  \\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nFDA’s inspection in May 2018 documented [PV]significant[E] deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We [PV]acknowledge[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] dated June 5, 2018; however, your [PV]response[E] does not adequately [PV]address[E] the deviations, as discussed below. \\n \\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to adequately investigate and implement corrective [PV]actions[E] when laboratory assays of drug [PV]components[E] indicated that medicated [PV]feed[E] was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such [PV]records[E] on the premises for [PV]one[E] year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your “Sandhills Select Horse Feed”, [PV]lot[E] code #10/02/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your “(b)(4)” [PV]lot[E] code #11/22/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no [PV]records[E] were provided of an investigation or corrective [PV]actions[E] regarding this incident. \\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] discusses your corrective [PV]actions[E] for the Sandhills Select Horse [PV]feed[E] and the (b)(4) non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] which NDA sampled and [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] new [PV]animal[E] drugs. Your [PV]response[E] stated that you [PV]sent[E] retained [PV]samples[E] for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and [PV]trained[E] employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your [PV]response[E] does not indicate you have investigated the [PV]cause[E] of these [PV]two[E] lab results. These [PV]results[E] could have a [PV]variety[E] of [NV]causes[E] from [PV]situations[E] other than carryover due to [NV]improper[E] sequencing. For example, carryover may [PV]occur[E] because no flush was implemented, or an [PV]ineffective[E] flush occurred. In addition, the presence of [NV]drugs[E] in a non-medicated [PV]feed[E] may [PV]result[E] from an operator or [PV]machine[E] [NV]error[E] that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective [PV]actions[E] do not [PV]identify[E] the root [PV]cause[E] of the incidents and do not [PV]address[E] the other [PV]possible[E] [PV]ways[E] the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\n \\n2.        You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated [PV]feeds[E] intended for [PV]use[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of medicated [PV]feeds[E] to [PV]aid[E] in assuring the identity, strength, [PV]quality[E] and [PV]purity[E] of these drug [PV]sources[E] as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we [PV]found[E] multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, [NV]used[E] to further [PV]manufacture[E] [PV]animal[E] food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the [PV]following[E] new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] were not [PV]recorded[E] in your drug inventory:\\n \\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) – (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\n \\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted [PV]additional[E] [PV]training[E] to [PV]ensure[E] all new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] are included on your drug records. You included the SOP [PV]signed[E] by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the [PV]effectiveness[E] of your SOP and [PV]training[E] at our next inspection.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the incidents [PV]listed[E] above, in June 2018 your [PV]firm[E] bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for [PV]internal[E] use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently [PV]fed[E] to your customer’s [PV]cattle[E] and resulted in the [PV]death[E] of four cows and [NV]illness[E] of [PV]two[E] cows. We [PV]acknowledge[E] that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and [PV]submitted[E] a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued [NV]lack[E] of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B. These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, [PV]please[E] [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.\\n \\nIn addition, you are now [PV]subject[E] to the [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.  Please [PV]see[E] our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:\\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) business [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific [PV]steps[E] you are [PV]taking[E] or have [NV]taken[E] to [NV]correct[E] these violations, including an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these violations, or similar [NV]violations[E] from occurring again. More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to [PV]address[E] systemic problems) your [PV]firm[E] has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections will [PV]occur[E] over time, [PV]please[E] [PV]include[E] a timetable for [PV]implementation[E] of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] within which these activities will be completed.\\n \\nPlease [PV]send[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] to Danial S. Hutchison, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 8050 Marshall Dr., Suite 205, Lenexa, KS 66214.

       "2     Adam L. Bonovsky\\nManager\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\n \\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\n \\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial [PV]feed[E] mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in [PV]response[E] to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the [PV]death[E] of five horses after consuming your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA [PV]found[E] through laboratory analysis that your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 [PV]contained[E] monensin. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\n \\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 [NV]causes[E] it to be [NV]unsafe[E] because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug was not [NV]used[E] in conformance with the drug [NV]approval[E] as outlined in [PV]section[E] 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed [NV]violations[E] of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and [PV]section[E] 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\n \\nMedicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA’s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulterated Animal Food\\n \\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a [PV]sample[E] of your non-medicated [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The [PV]sample[E] analysis [PV]found[E] 143 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for [PV]use[E] in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may [PV]experience[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequence[E] such as tachycardia, ataxia, or [NV]gross[E] [NV]lesions[E] in [NV]cardiac[E] and [NV]skeletal[E] [PV]muscles[E] after consuming monensin.  As a result, the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug [NV]approval[E] for monensin requires the [PV]following[E] [NV]caution[E] statement to be [PV]placed[E] on all formulations [PV]containing[E] monensin:  “Do not [NV]allow[E] horses or other equines access to [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,” 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] a [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is [NV]unsafe[E] and adulterated because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] and its labeling, distribution, holding, and [PV]use[E] does not conform to the approved [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug application.[1]\\n \\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] of the medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) [PV]observed[E] during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]use[E] adequate procedures for all equipment [NV]used[E] in the [PV]production[E] and distribution of medicated [NV]feeds[E] to avoid [NV]unsafe[E] [NV]contamination[E] of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\n \\nYour batching and mixing [NV]operations[E] are [NV]inadequate[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that your medicated [PV]feed[E] does not [NV]contaminate[E] other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a [PV]custom[E] [PV]cattle[E] mix [PV]containing[E] (b)(4) (monensin). After the [PV]manufacture[E] of this medicated feed, it does not appear [PV]steps[E] were [NV]taken[E] to either flush or [NV]clean[E] equipment. The [PV]two[E] batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin [PV]custom[E] steer mix and a non-medicated [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985, were both [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] monensin. Your [PV]facility[E] notes on the batching [PV]records[E] the [PV]following[E] procedure:  “(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.”  You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]document[E] that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your [PV]facility[E] cannot [PV]ensure[E] your flushing procedure was [PV]followed[E] after [PV]manufacture[E] of a medicated feed. This is a repeat [NV]violation[E] from the previous inspection where it was [PV]noted[E] that your [PV]firm[E] is not documenting on the [PV]production[E] [PV]record[E] when a flush occurs.\\n \\nAdditionally, it was [PV]noted[E] during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal [PV]ribbon[E] within the drum, on the horizontal [PV]ribbon[E] in [PV]front[E] of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was [PV]noted[E] that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule [PV]established[E] for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and [NV]lack[E] of cleaning may [PV]contribute[E] to the carry-over of [NV]drugs[E] from [PV]one[E] batch to another because build-up [PV]containing[E] [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] on equipment [PV]can[E] dislodge during [PV]manufacturing[E] of subsequent batches and [NV]contaminate[E] the batch with the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug. \\n \\n2.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] formula, production, and distribution [PV]records[E] to [PV]identify[E] the formulation. Records must be maintained which [PV]identify[E] the formulation, [PV]date[E] of mixing, and [PV]date[E] of shipment (if not for own use).  The [PV]records[E] shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated [PV]feed[E] that have been distributed.  Such [PV]records[E] shall be retained on the premises for [PV]one[E] year [PV]following[E] the [PV]date[E] of [NV]last[E] distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\n \\nYour medicated [PV]feed[E] batching [PV]records[E] [PV]include[E] a [PV]space[E] to [PV]record[E] the drug name, [PV]lot[E] number, and [PV]pounds[E] per batch. During a [PV]review[E] of your [PV]records[E] on June 4, 2018, your [PV]production[E] [PV]records[E] did not have any entries for the drug name, drug [PV]lot[E] number, and amount of drug [NV]used[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat [NV]violation[E] from the previous inspection where it was [PV]noted[E] that your [PV]firm[E] [NV]failed[E] to [PV]document[E] drug [PV]lot[E] numbers on the [PV]production[E] [PV]record[E] when [PV]manufacturing[E] medicated feeds.\\n \\n3.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]identify[E] and [PV]store[E] bulk Type B medicated [NV]feeds[E] in a [PV]manner[E] such that their identity, strength, quality, and [PV]purity[E] will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\n \\nOur investigator [PV]observed[E] several [PV]open[E] bulk bays where Type B medicated [NV]feeds[E] including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\n \\nTo date, the [PV]agency[E] has not received any [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] from your [PV]firm[E] [PV]regarding[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] non-compliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] non-compliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\n \\n(b)(3)(A)\\n \\nThe Reportable Food Registry was [PV]established[E] by [PV]section[E] 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to [PV]provide[E] a [PV]reliable[E] mechanism to [PV]track[E] patterns of adulteration in [PV]food[E] to [PV]support[E] efforts by FDA to target limited inspection [PV]resources[E] to protect the [PV]public[E] health.  It requires a [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] to file a [NV]report[E] when there is a [PV]reasonable[E] [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, an article of [PV]food[E] will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to humans or animals.\\nSuch [PV]foods[E] are “Reportable Foods.”  The [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] is the [PV]person[E] who submits the registration under [PV]section[E] 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350f(d), for a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] that is required to register under [PV]section[E] 415(a), at which such article of [PV]food[E] is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to [PV]submit[E] a required [NV]report[E] about a reportable [PV]food[E] is a prohibited act under [PV]section[E] 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(mm).\\n \\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [PV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal [PV]food[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are [PV]subject[E] to specific CGMPs, such as medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as [PV]well[E] as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, [PV]please[E] [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/ GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nIn addition, you are now [PV]subject[E] to the [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate [PV]identified[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please [PV]see[E] FDA’s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within 15 business [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter.

       "3     On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or “we”) received a [NV]complaint[E] (“January 24 complaint”) from a consumer who reported the [NV]death[E] of [PV]two[E] kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens [PV]ate[E] your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In [PV]response[E] to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic [PV]samples[E] collected during the necropsy of [PV]one[E] of the kittens that died after [PV]eating[E] your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten’s spleen, kidney, and [NV]small[E] [NV]intestine[E] was identical to the Salmonella [NV]isolated[E] from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the [PV]source[E] of illness.  \\n \\nAlso, in [PV]response[E] to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]facility[E] at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product [PV]sample[E] of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]found[E] [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella.  \\n \\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] in [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] may [PV]result[E] in [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] to [PV]animals[E] consuming the [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] and/or humans [PV]handling[E] the [PV]pet[E] food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they [PV]bear[E] or [PV]contain[E] a [NV]poisonous[E] or deleterious [PV]substance[E] which may render such products injurious to health.  The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce of an adulterated [PV]food[E] is a [NV]violation[E] of [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].  You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAfter FDA notified you of the [PV]sample[E] results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you [PV]placed[E] BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on [PV]hold[E] [NV]pending[E] [PV]sample[E] [PV]results[E] and no portion of the [PV]lot[E] was never distributed. \\n \\nPrior Samples\\n \\nWe note that your [PV]firm[E] has had prior instances of [NV]contamination[E] with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent [NV]problems[E] with your [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]processes[E] and/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received [PV]two[E] consumer [NV]complaints[E] [PV]regarding[E] your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened [PV]samples[E] of your products in [PV]response[E] to these [NV]complaints[E] and the [PV]table[E] below summarizes the results.\\n \\nProduct\\nFDA Sample Number\\nDate Collected\\nPositive Results\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\n892533\\n11/14/2016\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\nBRB for Dogs\\n977933\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB for Dogs\\n915615\\n11/21/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\nBRB Turkey w/ Bone\\n959477\\n12/14/2016\\nL. monocytogenes\\nBRB Beef Complete\\n959478\\n12/14/2016\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\n \\nOn June 15, 2017, we [PV]sent[E] you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the [PV]results[E] of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the [PV]lots[E] that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\n \\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\n \\nUnlike other [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products [PV]present[E] [PV]particular[E] hazards to human and [PV]animal[E] [NV]health[E] because they [PV]contain[E] uncooked [PV]animal[E] proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] is [PV]produced[E] with minimal [PV]processing[E] and is intended to be [PV]handled[E] by humans and [PV]fed[E] to [PV]animals[E] without cooking, that is, without [PV]measures[E] routinely [NV]used[E] to [NV]kill[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] pathogens. It is therefore [PV]essential[E] that your [PV]firm[E] has [PV]measures[E] in [PV]place[E] to prevent and [NV]reduce[E] pathogenic [NV]contamination[E] of your products and facility. \\n \\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] and sometimes [NV]fatal[E] infections in both humans and animals. Pets [PV]like[E] [PV]dogs[E] and [PV]cats[E] may [PV]get[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]eating[E] contaminated [PV]pet[E] foods. People may also [PV]contract[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]handling[E] these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] or having [PV]contact[E] with infected [PV]pets[E] or their feces. Infections can be especially [PV]serious[E] in [PV]young[E] children, elderly people, and others with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems. Healthy individuals, as [PV]well[E] as pets, may [NV]suffer[E] short-term symptoms such as [NV]severe[E] diarrhea, [NV]bloody[E] diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial [PV]heat[E] [PV]step[E] or other commercial process to [NV]kill[E] the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA’s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/iceci/compliancemanuals/compliancepolicyguidancemanual/ucm361105.pdf\\n \\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute [PV]danger[E] to human and [PV]animal[E] health. It can proliferate in [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] can [PV]lead[E] to a severe, sometimes life-threatening [NV]illness[E] [PV]called[E] listeriosis. Pregnant [PV]women[E] and [PV]people[E] with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems, including [PV]young[E] children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more [NV]vulnerable[E] to these infections. Healthy [PV]individuals[E] as [PV]well[E] as [PV]pets[E] may [NV]suffer[E] short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\n \\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\n \\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your [PV]firm[E] [PV]uses[E] a (b)(4) during [PV]manufacturing[E] to [NV]reduce[E] the presence of pathogens in your [PV]pet[E] foods. \\n \\nAny [PV]substance[E] that is [PV]reasonably[E] expected to [PV]become[E] a [PV]component[E] of [PV]food[E] is a [PV]food[E] additive that is [PV]subject[E] to premarket [PV]approval[E] by FDA, unless the [PV]substance[E] is generally [PV]recognized[E] as [PV]safe[E] (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific [PV]training[E] and [PV]experience[E] to evaluate its [PV]safety[E] under the [NV]conditions[E] of its intended use, [PV]meets[E] [PV]one[E] of the other exclusions from the [PV]food[E] additive definition in [PV]section[E] 201(s) of the FD&C Act, or is otherwise permitted for [PV]use[E] in [PV]animal[E] food. There is no [PV]food[E] additive regulation that authorizes [PV]use[E] of (b)(4) in [PV]animal[E] food, and the agency is [PV]unaware[E] of any data or [PV]information[E] to [NV]demonstrate[E] that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the [NV]conditions[E] of intended [PV]use[E] (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\n \\nWe received your [PV]written[E] response, dated March 29, 2018, [PV]following[E] the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the [PV]use[E] of your “active [NV]kill[E] agents” during manufacturing, including the [PV]use[E] of (b)(4). However, we are [NV]unable[E] to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your [PV]response[E] lacks [PV]important[E] specific [PV]details[E] [PV]showing[E] evidence of the [PV]safety[E] of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products. Also, your [PV]response[E] does not address whether you have [NV]determined[E] these “kill agents” are in fact GRAS under their intended [NV]conditions[E] of use.\\n \\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and [PV]processing[E] practices. Some of these changes [PV]include[E] but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the [PV]facility[E] from [PV]outside[E] environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the [PV]use[E] of sanitizing [PV]foot[E] baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective [PV]actions[E] will be evaluated during our next inspection of your [PV]manufacturing[E] facility.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this [PV]letter[E] are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of [NV]violations[E] that exist in connection with your product(s). You are [PV]responsible[E] for investigating and [PV]determining[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] [PV]identified[E] above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [PV]firm[E] complies with all requirements of [NV]federal[E] law and FDA regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the above violations, we have the [PV]following[E] comments:\\n \\nWe note that your [PV]facility[E] is [PV]subject[E] to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for [PV]food[E] for [PV]animals[E] (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B), which [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please [PV]see[E] FDA’s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM499200.pdf.   \\n \\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are [PV]known[E] and [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards in [NV]raw[E] [PV]meat[E] [PV]pet[E] food. For more [PV]information[E] on this topic, you may [PV]refer[E] to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/UCM592870.pdf.\\n \\nWithin fifteen [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receipt of this letter, [PV]please[E] notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] that you have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] violations. Include an [PV]explanation[E] of each [PV]step[E] being [NV]taken[E] to prevent the recurrence of violations, as [PV]well[E] as copies of related documentation.

Review of the documentation revealed that your [PV]response[E] is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\n \\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), [NV]failure[E] of a [PV]seafood[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facility[E] to have and implement a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that complies with this [PV]section[E] or otherwise [NV]operate[E] in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the [PV]fish[E] or fishery products adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried [PV]fish[E] products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or [PV]held[E] under [NV]conditions[E] whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may [PV]find[E] the Act, the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through [PV]links[E] on FDA's [PV]home[E] [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations [PV]regarding[E] identification and control of [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] for your [PV]fish[E] and fishery products, can be [PV]found[E] on our web site at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/seafood/ucm2018426.htm\\n \\nWe [PV]found[E] the [PV]following[E] [PV]significant[E] deviations:  \\n \\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a [NV]hazard[E] analysis for each [PV]kind[E] of [PV]fish[E] and fishery product that you [PV]produce[E] to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as 'any biological, chemical, or physical property that may [PV]cause[E] a [PV]food[E] to be [NV]unsafe[E] for human consumption.' However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of [NV]natural[E] toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in [PV]yellow[E] stripe trevally [NV]caught[E] in [PV]tropical[E] and subtropical [PV]waters[E] that your [PV]firm[E] needs to control as the [PV]primary[E] processor receiving the [PV]fish[E] directly from the [PV]harvest[E] vessels.  \\n \\n2.    You must conduct a [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a 'point, step, or procedure in a [PV]food[E] [PV]process[E] at which control can be [PV]applied[E] and a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] can as a [PV]result[E] be prevented, eliminated, or [NV]reduced[E] to acceptable levels.' However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] “Dried Fish” does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]following[E] CCPs that are necessary to control each of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards. Specifically,\\n \\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in your dried scombroid species [PV]fish[E] while [PV]held[E] (b)(4). FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] a refrigerated [PV]storage[E] CCP to [PV]ensure[E] that products [PV]held[E] for extended [PV]time[E] periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4° C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by [PV]ice[E] throughout the [PV]storage[E] period.\\n \\nb.  A (b)(4) [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation. FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] salting and curing CCPs to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]fish[E] are [PV]held[E] at [PV]appropriate[E] temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation (i.e., including the [PV]potential[E] for growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation from the [PV]salt[E] tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism [PV]identified[E] in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the [PV]fish[E] are continuously [PV]held[E] at 4.4° C or below for the entire duration of the salting/curing step.\\n \\n3.    You must have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A [NV]critical[E] limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as 'the maximum or minimum [PV]value[E] to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to prevent, eliminate, or [NV]reduce[E] to an acceptable [PV]level[E] the occurrence of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazard.' However, your firm’s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email for “Dried Fish” [PV]lists[E] [NV]critical[E] limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the “(b)(4)” [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] your [NV]critical[E] limit of “(b)(4)” [NV]alone[E] is not adequate to control the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards.  FDA recommends that you also [PV]include[E] corresponding [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] or temperature or a combination of both at this [PV]step[E] to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a [PV]safe[E] [PV]water[E] activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the [PV]fish[E] flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this “(b)(4)” CCP [PV]list[E] [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4)°C. Although (b)(4)°C is [PV]sufficient[E] to control S. aureusgrowth/toxin formation, it is [NV]inadequate[E] to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60°C or higher to inhibit/prevent histamine formation during extended drying/dehydration [PV]time[E] periods when there is no [NV]critical[E] limit for time. At your current [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) – (b)(4) °C, FDA recommends that you [PV]establish[E] through a scientific study, the [PV]processing[E] parameters that will [PV]allow[E] the [PV]fish[E] [NV]flesh[E] to achieve a [PV]water[E] activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures [PV]currently[E] [PV]listed[E] in your monitoring procedures should be [PV]listed[E] as [NV]critical[E] limits if they are [NV]critical[E] drying factors.  This would also [PV]apply[E] to any [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] that you [PV]establish[E] as [NV]critical[E] to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your [PV]firm[E] is monitoring the moisture [NV]conditions[E] in the solar dome. If this is a [NV]critical[E] factor, you should [PV]consider[E] [PV]establishing[E] a [NV]critical[E] limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\n \\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific things you are doing to [PV]correct[E] these violations. More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation and [PV]information[E] that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) [PV]consecutive[E] [PV]days[E] of completed monitoring [PV]records[E] (i.e., [PV]complete[E] [PV]sets[E] of monitoring [PV]records[E] for the [PV]production[E] of 5 [PV]production[E] [PV]date[E] codes of products) to [PV]demonstrate[E] [PV]implementation[E] of the plan, and any [PV]additional[E] [PV]information[E] that you [PV]wish[E] to supply that provides assurance of your [PV]intent[E] to fully comply now and in the [PV]future[E] with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation. If you cannot [PV]complete[E] all corrections within 15 days, you should [PV]explain[E] the [PV]reason[E] for your [NV]delay[E] and state when you will [PV]correct[E] any [PV]remaining[E] violations. If you [PV]believe[E] you have complied with FDA regulations, [PV]include[E] your [PV]reasoning[E] and any [PV]supporting[E] [PV]information[E] for our consideration.\\n \\nIf you do not [PV]respond[E] or if we [PV]find[E] your [PV]response[E] inadequate, we may [PV]take[E] further action. For instance, we may [PV]take[E] further [PV]action[E] to [NV]refuse[E] admission of your imported [PV]fish[E] or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 381(a)), including [PV]placing[E] them on [NV]detention[E] without physical examination (DWPE). FDA’s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products [PV]offered[E] for [PV]import[E] into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE [PV]information[E] may be conveyed in FDA’s Import Alerts. For your information, an [PV]example[E] of an Import Alert that conveys [PV]information[E] specific to [PV]foreign[E] [PV]firms[E] that are not in compliance with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This [PV]alert[E] can be [PV]found[E] on FDA’s web site at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_25.html\\n \\nThis [PV]letter[E] may not [PV]list[E] all the deviations at your facility. You are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring that your [PV]processing[E] [PV]plant[E] [PV]operates[E] in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to [PV]use[E] procedures to prevent further [NV]violations[E] of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\n \\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a [PV]foreign[E] facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the [PV]foreign[E] facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any re-inspection-related costs.

       "5     This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your [PV]website[E] at the Internet [PV]address[E] www.kratomwholesale.us in August 2018 and has [NV]determined[E] that you [PV]take[E] orders there for [PV]various[E] kratom products, including but not limited to, “Bali Green Kratom Powder,” “Bali Red Kratom Powder,” “Borneo Green Kratom Powder,” “Borneo Red Vein Kratom,” “Horned Kratom Powder,” “Vietnam Kratom Powder,” “Malaysian White Vein Kratom Powder,” “Thai White Vein Kratom Powder,” “Thai Red Vein Kratom Powder,” and “Maeng Da Kratom Powder.” FDA has [NV]determined[E] that these products are unapproved new [NV]drugs[E] [PV]sold[E] in [NV]violation[E] of [PV]sections[E] 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded [NV]drugs[E] under [PV]section[E] 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352. You [PV]can[E] [PV]find[E] the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through [PV]links[E] on FDA’s [PV]home[E] [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nOn October 26, 2017, the Acting Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, under [PV]section[E] 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d, [NV]determined[E] that a [PV]public[E] [PV]health[E] [NV]emergency[E] [PV]exists[E] nationwide [PV]involving[E] the opioid crisis. As [PV]described[E] in more [PV]detail[E] below, you [PV]market[E] [PV]various[E] kratom products for, among other things, the treatment or [PV]cure[E] of opioid [NV]addiction[E] and [NV]withdrawal[E] symptoms. However, these products have not been [NV]determined[E] by FDA to be [NV]safe[E] and [NV]effective[E] for these (or any other) uses. Further, the unproven treatments could [PV]cause[E] [NV]patients[E] to forego or [NV]delay[E] FDA-approved treatments for opioid [NV]addiction[E] and withdrawal. The [PV]marketing[E] and [PV]sale[E] of unapproved opioid [NV]addiction[E] treatment products is a potentially [PV]significant[E] [NV]threat[E] to the [PV]public[E] health. Therefore, FDA is [PV]taking[E] [PV]measures[E] to protect consumers from products that, without [NV]approval[E] by FDA, [PV]claim[E] to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, [PV]treat[E] or [PV]cure[E] opioid addiction.\\n \\nUnapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs\\n \\nClaims on your [PV]website[E] [PV]establish[E] that the above-mentioned products are [NV]drugs[E] as defined by [PV]section[E] 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for [PV]use[E] in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of [NV]disease[E] — including opiate [NV]withdrawal[E] and addiction, and/or because they are intended to affect the structure or [PV]function[E] of the body. As [PV]explained[E] further below, introducing or delivering these products for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce for such [PV]uses[E] violates the FD&C Act. \\n \\nExamples of [NV]claims[E] [PV]observed[E] on the [PV]website[E] where you [PV]take[E] orders, www.kratomwholesale.us, that [PV]establish[E] the intended [PV]use[E] of your products include, but may not be limited to the following: \\n \\nOn the webpage titled “About Kratom”:\\n“Kratom [PV]can[E] render both mildly [PV]stimulating[E] [PV]effects[E] and mildly [NV]relaxing[E] [PV]effects[E] depending upon the measurement used. At [NV]smaller[E] amounts, the [PV]effects[E] tend to be slightly more stimulating; and at larger amounts, the [PV]effects[E] tend to be more relaxing.”\\n“Some [kratom users] have reported an increase in focus, attentiveness, and [PV]social[E] confidence resulting from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]use[E] of kratom.”\\n“Due to the rise in [NV]opium[E] costs and the [PV]discovery[E] that kratom could [PV]relieve[E] [NV]opium[E] withdrawals, many users [PV]turned[E] to kratom as a means to [PV]cure[E] their addiction.”\\n“It has been long reported that kratom has been [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] a myriad of ailments including but not limited to: diarrhea, depression, diabetes, obesity, [NV]high[E] blood pressure, stomach parasites, diverticulitis, anxiety, alcoholism, and opiate withdrawal.”\\nOn the webpage with the Blog dated February 3, titled “(b)(6) Battle with Opiate Addiction”:\\n“One [PV]way[E] to avoid the synthetic roller coaster of [NV]addiction[E] is to opt for a [PV]natural[E] [PV]alternative[E] – kratom.

Yes there is – kratom. Kratom has been [NV]used[E] for hundreds of years to [PV]help[E] [NV]eliminate[E] [NV]withdrawal[E] symptoms from opiates of all kinds. Kratom has been [NV]used[E] to [PV]treat[E] everything from [PV]mild[E] [NV]pain[E] pill [NV]addiction[E] to [NV]heroin[E] addiction.” \\nYour kratom products are also “new drugs” under [PV]section[E] 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as [NV]safe[E] and [NV]effective[E] for [PV]use[E] under the [NV]conditions[E] prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Under [PV]section[E] 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), new [NV]drugs[E] may not be introduced or delivered for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce without prior [NV]approval[E] from FDA. No approved application pursuant to [PV]section[E] 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), is in [PV]effect[E] for these products. Accordingly, the [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce of these products violates [PV]sections[E] 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). \\n \\nIn addition, your kratom products are misbranded under 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), because they [NV]lack[E] adequate directions for use. Section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), identifies criteria for [PV]determining[E] the prescription status of a product. Your above-mentioned kratom products are prescription [NV]drugs[E] as defined in [PV]section[E] 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), because in [PV]light[E] of their [NV]toxicity[E] or other potentiality for [NV]harmful[E] effect, or the [PV]method[E] of their use, or the collateral [PV]measures[E] necessary to their use, they are not [NV]safe[E] for [PV]use[E] except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. \\n \\nYour above-mentioned kratom products are intended for the treatment or [PV]cure[E] of opioid [NV]addiction[E] and [NV]withdrawal[E] symptoms, and/or other [NV]conditions[E] that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. A drug is misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), if the drug [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” is defined in 21 CFR 201.5 as “directions under which the layman [PV]can[E] [PV]use[E] a drug [PV]safely[E] and for the [PV]purposes[E] for which it is intended.”  Because the [NV]conditions[E] for which your above-mentioned kratom products are intended require the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs, adequate directions cannot be [PV]written[E] so that a layperson [PV]can[E] [PV]use[E] your products safely. Thus, your kratom products’ labeling [NV]fail[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended uses, which [NV]causes[E] the products to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce of these misbranded [NV]drugs[E] violates [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\\n \\nThe [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this [PV]letter[E] are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of [NV]violations[E] that exist in connection with your marketed products.

       "6     Mr. Jeffery A. Dolezal\\nMr. Mark G. Dolezal\\nMr. Mark R. Dolezal\\n \\nCo-Owners\\nDolezal Dairy\\n947 - 24th Road\\nPender, Nebraska 68047\\n \\nDear Messrs. Dolezal\\n \\nOn June 5, 2018 and June 11, 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your [PV]dairy[E] operation, Dolezal Dairy, located at 947 - 24th Road Pender, Nebraska. This [PV]letter[E] notifies you of [NV]violations[E] of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that were revealed during our investigation of your operation. You can [PV]find[E] the FD&C Act and its associated regulations on the Internet through [PV]links[E] on the FDA’s web [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nAdulteration of an Animal Offered for Human Consumption:\\nWe [PV]found[E] that you [PV]offered[E] for [PV]sale[E] an [PV]animal[E] for [NV]slaughter[E] as [PV]food[E] that was adulterated. Under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), a [PV]food[E] is deemed to be adulterated if it [PV]bears[E] or [PV]contains[E] a new [PV]animal[E] drug that is [NV]unsafe[E] under [PV]section[E] 512 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b. Further, under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4), a [PV]food[E] is deemed to be adulterated if it has been [PV]held[E] under insanitary [NV]conditions[E] whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\\n \\nSpecifically, our investigation revealed that on or about March 22, 2018, you [PV]sold[E] a [PV]cow[E] for [NV]slaughter[E] as food, with a [PV]green[E] ear [PV]tag[E] numbered (b)(4) on the [PV]front[E] and on the back, (b)(4) and (b)(4)(cow with ear [PV]tag[E] (b)(4)). You [PV]sold[E] this [PV]cow[E] at (b)(4) on March 22, 2018, and it was subsequently slaughtered on March 23, 2018 at (b)(4). The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) analysis of tissue [PV]samples[E] collected from this [PV]animal[E] [PV]identified[E] the presence of desfuroylceftiofur (marker [NV]residue[E] for ceftiofur) at 8.649 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) in kidney tissue. FDA has [PV]established[E] a [PV]tolerance[E] of 0.4 ppm for residues of desfuroylceftiofur in uncooked [PV]edible[E] tissues of [PV]cattle[E] as codified in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), [PV]section[E] 556.113 (21 C.F.R. § 556.113). The presence of this drug in [PV]edible[E] tissue from this [PV]animal[E] in this amount [NV]causes[E] the [PV]food[E] to be adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii).\\n \\nOur investigation also [PV]found[E] that you [PV]hold[E] [PV]animals[E] under [NV]conditions[E] that are so [NV]inadequate[E] that medicated [PV]animals[E] [PV]bearing[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] drug residues are [PV]likely[E] to [PV]enter[E] the [PV]food[E] supply. You [NV]lack[E] an adequate system to [PV]ensure[E] that [PV]animals[E] medicated by you have been withheld from [NV]slaughter[E] for [PV]appropriate[E] periods of [PV]time[E] to permit depletion of potentially [NV]hazardous[E] residues of [NV]drugs[E] from [PV]edible[E] tissues. For example, you [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] [PV]complete[E] and [PV]accurate[E] treatment records. Treatment [PV]records[E] must [PV]include[E] the [NV]condition[E] being treated, dosage, route of administration, the [PV]person[E] who administered treatment, and [NV]withdrawal[E] times. Complete [PV]records[E] should [PV]include[E] this information, as [PV]well[E] as diagnosis and indications for use.  Food from [PV]animals[E] [PV]held[E] under such [NV]conditions[E] is adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4).\\n \\nAdulteration of a New Animal Drug\\nWe also [PV]found[E] that you adulterated the new [PV]animal[E] drug Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline [PV]free[E] acid, ANADA 141-209). Specifically, our investigation revealed that you did not [PV]use[E] this drug as directed by its approved labeling. Use of this drug in this [PV]manner[E] is an extra-label use, as defined by 21 C.F.R. § 530.3(a).\\n \\nThe [PV]extra[E] label [PV]use[E] of approved [PV]animal[E] or human [NV]drugs[E] in [PV]animals[E] is [PV]allowed[E] under the FD&C Act only if the extra-label [PV]use[E] complies with [PV]sections[E] 512(a)(4) and (5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360b(a)(4) and (5), and 21 CFR Part 530, including that the [PV]use[E] must be by or on the [PV]lawful[E] order of a licensed [PV]veterinarian[E] within the [PV]context[E] of a [PV]valid[E] veterinarian/client/patient relationship. Extra-label [PV]use[E] of this drug, if not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, may cause additional violative drug residues.\\n \\nOur investigation [PV]found[E] you administered Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline [PV]free[E] acid) to a [PV]dairy[E] [PV]cow[E] with ear [PV]tag[E] (b)(4) without [PV]following[E] the indications for [PV]use[E] and [NV]withdrawal[E] [PV]time[E] as stated in the approved labeling. You [PV]admitted[E] to [PV]using[E] Excede™ for unapproved [PV]uses[E] including treating [PV]cow[E] with ear [PV]tag[E] (b)(4) with 18 mL of Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline [PV]free[E] acid) via a subcutaneously [NV]injection[E] [NV]behind[E] the ear for treatment of [NV]diarrhea[E] and fever. Excede™ is not approved for treatment for [NV]diarrhea[E] and fever. Also, you [PV]admitted[E] to entering the [NV]wrong[E] [PV]date[E] in your calendar, which caused you to [PV]sell[E] the [PV]cow[E] with ear [PV]tag[E] (b)(4) before the [NV]end[E] of the [PV]meat[E] [NV]withdrawal[E] [NV]period[E] specified in the approved labeling. Your extra-label [PV]use[E] of Excede™ (ceftiofur crystalline [PV]free[E] acid) was not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, in [NV]violation[E] of 21 C.F.R. § 530.11(a), and resulted in [NV]illegal[E] drug residues, in [NV]violation[E] of 21 C.F.R. § 530.11(d). \\n \\nBecause your [PV]use[E] of these [NV]drugs[E] was not in conformance with their approved labeling and did not comply with 21 C.F.R. Part 530, you caused the [NV]drugs[E] to be [NV]unsafe[E] under [PV]section[E] 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), and adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5).\\n \\nProhibited Act (301h) False Guaranty\\nOur investigation also revealed that on or about October 13, 2011, Mark R. Dolezal, Co-Owner of Dolezal Dairy, [PV]signed[E] a Consignor/Livestock Owner’s Certificate to (b)(4) that certifies that none of the livestock [PV]delivered[E] to (b)(4) will have an [NV]illegal[E] [PV]level[E] of drug residues or the [PV]producer[E] will inform the (b)(4) of any [NV]drugs[E] the livestock have been given. On or about March 22, 2018, you [PV]delivered[E] a [PV]cow[E] from your [PV]farm[E] to (b)(4) which [PV]contained[E] violative residues of desfuroylceftiofur. Providing such a [NV]false[E] guaranty is prohibited by [PV]section[E] 301(h) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(h). You should [PV]take[E] [PV]appropriate[E] [PV]actions[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that this [NV]violation[E] does not recur.\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a [PV]producer[E] of [PV]animals[E] [PV]offered[E] for [PV]use[E] as food, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring that your overall [NV]operation[E] and the [PV]food[E] you distribute is in compliance with the law.\\n \\nYou should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]described[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and to [PV]establish[E] procedures to [PV]ensure[E] that these [NV]violations[E] do not recur. Failure to do so may [PV]result[E] in regulatory [PV]action[E] without further notice, such as [NV]seizure[E] and/or injunction. \\n \\nYou should notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] of the [PV]steps[E] you have [NV]taken[E] to bring your [PV]firm[E] into compliance with the law within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receiving this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] each [PV]step[E] that has been [NV]taken[E] or will be [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] and prevent their recurrence. If corrective [PV]action[E] cannot be completed within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receiving this letter, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] [PV]frame[E] within which the corrections will be completed. Please [PV]include[E] copies of any [PV]available[E] documentation demonstrating that corrections have been made.\\n \\nYour [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] should be [PV]sent[E] to: Attn: Tamara J. Umscheid, Compliance Officer, 8050 Marshall Drive, Suite 205, Lenexa, Kansas, 66214. If you have any [PV]questions[E] about this letter, [PV]please[E] [PV]contact[E] Tamara J.

       "7     Omar Ishrak\\nChairman & CEO\\nMedtronic Inc.\\n710 Medtronic Parkway NE\\nMinneapolis, MN 55432\\n \\nDear Mr. Ishrak:\\n \\nDuring an inspection of Medtronic Puerto Rico Operations Company (MPROC), located at Ceiba Norte Industrial Park, 50 Road 31, Km 24.4, Juncos, Puerto Rico, on April 23 through May 15, 2018, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [PV]determined[E] that Medtronic MPROC Juncos manufactures implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, [NV]cardiac[E] resynchronization devices, and other related products. Under [PV]section[E] 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for [PV]use[E] in the diagnosis of [NV]disease[E] or other [NV]conditions[E] or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, or to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body.\\n \\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the [PV]methods[E] [NV]used[E] in, or the [PV]facilities[E] or controls [NV]used[E] for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current [NV]good[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] practice requirements of the Quality System regulation [NV]found[E] at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA’s regulations through [PV]links[E] in FDA’s [PV]home[E] [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nWe received your firm’s [PV]responses[E] dated June 6 and July 13, 2018, [NV]concerning[E] our investigators’ [PV]observations[E] [PV]noted[E] on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), Inspectional Observations, [NV]issued[E] to your [PV]firm[E] on May 15, 2018. We [PV]address[E] these [PV]responses[E] below in [PV]relation[E] to [NV]violations[E] [PV]observed[E] during the inspection, which include:\\n \\n1.    Failure to [PV]validate[E] a [PV]process[E] whose [PV]results[E] cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test according to [PV]established[E] procedures, which is required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). Specifically, (b)(4) [PV]processes[E] (b)(4)were not validated on Blackwell implantable [NV]cardiac[E] defibrillators (ICDs). These (b)(4) [PV]processes[E] (b)(4) in ICDs that [NV]failed[E] due to [PV]high[E] voltage arcing. This [PV]led[E] to your firm’s recall Z-0582/9-2018.\\n \\nWe reviewed your firm’s [PV]responses[E] to the FDA 483 and [PV]acknowledge[E] your [PV]commitment[E] to: (a) (b)(4) [PV]process[E] [PV]steps[E] (b)(4), (b) update supplemental [PV]material[E] for [PV]process[E] validation to clarify that each (b)(4) must be assessed and challenged during [PV]process[E] validation, (c) update the change control [PV]process[E] to incorporate [PV]instructions[E] on how to [PV]assess[E] [NV]risk[E] or unintended [NV]consequence[E] of (b)(4), (d) [PV]assess[E] (b)(4) [PV]processes[E] for ICDs to [PV]determine[E] if they were properly validated and have adequate [PV]process[E] controls, and (e) [PV]perform[E] an assessment of [PV]process[E] validations for Blackwell ICDs non-fully verifiable [PV]processes[E] to evaluate if applicable product specifications were challenged per [PV]process[E] validation and [PV]design[E] transfer requirements. Your [PV]responses[E] appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s [PV]actions[E] are [PV]still[E] in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance.\\n \\n2.   Failure to [PV]document[E] (b)(4) activities in the device [PV]history[E] [PV]record[E] (DHR) as required by 21 CFR 820.90(b)(2). Specifically, (b)(4) on implantable [NV]cardiac[E] defibrillators (ICDs) was not documented in device [PV]history[E] records.\\n \\nWe reviewed your firm’s [PV]responses[E] to the FDA 483 and [PV]acknowledge[E] your [PV]commitment[E] to: (a) (b)(4) process, (b) update product identification and traceability procedures to [PV]clarity[E] that (b)(4) must be documented, (c) update your [PV]training[E] of new hires and [PV]manufacturing[E] personnel, (d) [PV]assess[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]areas[E] to [PV]identify[E] whether similar conduct is occurring elsewhere, and (e) [PV]establish[E] more [PV]robust[E] equipment and/or procedure controls on ICD equipment [NV]used[E] in [PV]manufacturing[E] to [PV]help[E] prevent the occurrence of undocumented (b)(4). Your [PV]responses[E] appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm’s [PV]actions[E] are [PV]still[E] in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance.\\n \\nYour [PV]firm[E] should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in regulatory [PV]action[E] being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These [PV]actions[E] include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.  Also, [NV]federal[E] [NV]agencies[E] may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may [PV]take[E] this [PV]information[E] into [PV]account[E] when considering the [PV]award[E] of contracts. Additionally, premarket [PV]approval[E] applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation [NV]violations[E] are [PV]reasonably[E] related will not be approved until the [NV]violations[E] have been corrected.  Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the [NV]violations[E] related to the subject devices have been corrected.\\n \\nPlease notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) business [PV]days[E] from the [PV]date[E] you [PV]receive[E] this [PV]letter[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] has [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [PV]noted[E] violations, as [PV]well[E] as an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again.  Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective [PV]actions[E] (which must [PV]address[E] systemic problems) that your [PV]firm[E] has taken.  If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective [PV]actions[E] will [PV]occur[E] over time, [PV]please[E] [PV]include[E] a timetable for [PV]implementation[E] of those activities.  If corrections and/or corrective [PV]actions[E] cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s [PV]response[E] should be [PV]comprehensive[E] and [PV]address[E] all [NV]violations[E] included in this Warning Letter.\\n \\nAdditionally, our investigators [NV]cited[E] [PV]observations[E] on the FDA 483 in the [PV]areas[E] of corrective and preventive [PV]action[E] (21 CFR 820.100), [PV]acceptance[E] activities (21 CFR 820.80), statistical techniques (21 CFR 820.250), and inspection, measuring, and test equipment (21 CFR 820.72).  Your firm’s [PV]responses[E] appear to adequately [PV]address[E] these observations. Implementation and [PV]effectiveness[E] of your corrective [PV]actions[E] will be evaluated during a follow-up inspection.\\n \\nIf you have [PV]questions[E] [PV]regarding[E] this letter, [PV]please[E] [PV]contact[E] Timothy G. Philips, Compliance Officer, by telephone at 612-758-7133, or by e-mail at Timothy.Philips@fda.hhs.gov.

Any attachments should be labeled and/or [PV]identified[E] for [PV]ease[E] of review. Documentation should be [PV]submitted[E] as a [PV]single[E] pdf file, with bookmarks to [PV]easily[E] [PV]identify[E] [PV]table[E] of contents, memos, attachments, etc.   If a [PV]single[E] pdf file exceeds the 100MB size limit, [PV]please[E] [PV]submit[E] multiple pdf files, as appropriate. Refer to CMS Case #560736 when replying.\\n \\nFinally, you should [PV]know[E] that this [PV]letter[E] is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the [NV]violations[E] at your firm’s facility.  It is your firm’s responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA.  The specific [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, [NV]issued[E] at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of [PV]serious[E] [NV]problems[E] in your firm’s [PV]manufacturing[E] and [PV]quality[E] management systems.  Your [PV]firm[E] should investigate and [PV]determine[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the violations, and [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]actions[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] and bring the products into compliance. \\n \\nSincerely,\\n/S/ \\nBlake Bevill, MS\\nProgram Division Director\\nOffice of Medical Device and Radiological Health\\nDivision 2 – Central\\n

       "8     Dear Mr. Hanson:\\n \\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm’s medical device [NV]operations[E] at Zimmer, Biomet, Inc., 56 East Bell Drive, Warsaw, IN, from April 9 through 24, 2018. During the inspection, FDA investigators [PV]determined[E] that your [PV]firm[E] is a medical device manufacturer of orthopedic implants.  Under [PV]section[E] 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for [PV]use[E] in the diagnosis of [NV]disease[E] or other [NV]conditions[E] or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, or to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body.\\n \\nThis inspection revealed that your devices are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the [PV]methods[E] [NV]used[E] in, or the [PV]facilities[E] or controls [NV]used[E] for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current [PV]good[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] practice requirements of the Quality System regulation [NV]found[E] at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\\n \\nWe [PV]acknowledge[E] that during a Regulatory Meeting on April 27, 2017, Zimmer Biomet discussed “(b)(4),” a remediation project to [PV]address[E] FDA’s 2016 inspectional findings. We are also [PV]aware[E] that your [PV]firm[E] implemented numerous interim controls as [PV]immediate[E] containment and mitigation actions, including increased [PV]process[E] monitoring of validated [PV]processes[E] while remediation activities were in progress. However, our recent inspection revealed continuing, [PV]significant[E] [NV]violations[E] of the [PV]quality[E] system regulations.\\n \\nWe received a [PV]response[E] dated May 15, 2018 from Jeff Gensler, Vice President, Quality Assurance and Quality Control, which [PV]responded[E] to the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations [NV]issued[E] to your [PV]firm[E] on April 24, 2018. We are also in receipt of your July 31, 2018 status update. We [PV]address[E] your [PV]response[E] below, in [PV]relation[E] to each of the [PV]noted[E] violations. These [NV]violations[E] include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n \\n1.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures for verifying or validating the corrective and preventive action, to [PV]ensure[E] that such [PV]action[E] is [NV]effective[E] and does not adversely affect the finished device, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4). During the inspection, [PV]review[E] of three [NV]separate[E] CAPA’s revealed that your [PV]firm[E] has not been [NV]able[E] to [PV]demonstrate[E] that the corrective or preventive [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are [NV]effective[E] in ensuring that devices being distributed meet all finished product specifications.\\nCAPA CA-03092, was opened on December 1, 2016 to [PV]address[E] [NV]inadequate[E] [PV]process[E] validations and [PV]process[E] control procedures for in-process and final cleaning [NV]operations[E] that were revealed during the previous inspection. During the inspection, we [NV]observed[E] that you are monitoring your interim cleaning [PV]processes[E] by requiring testing for (b)(4) (i.e., [PV]cleanliness[E] tests). Your CAPA [PV]review[E] [NV]board[E] is [PV]responsible[E] for monitoring this data to [PV]ensure[E] it is [PV]meeting[E] your pre-established specifications. However, during the inspection we [NV]observed[E] an instance where your own data did not [PV]demonstrate[E] that your cleaning [PV]process[E] was [NV]capable[E] of [PV]meeting[E] the [PV]established[E] [PV]cleanliness[E] specification for (b)(4) group devices. For example, [PV]process[E] [PV]performance[E] indicators (Ppk’s) for (b)(4) were (b)(4) and (b)(4) from 1/28/2018 to 3/30/2018 and 12/16/2017 to 3/20/2018, respectively, which was [PV]well[E] below your specification of (b)(4) as required in INST 28.0.0.1 (b)(4).\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm’s [PV]ability[E] to verify the [PV]effectiveness[E] of the corrective [PV]actions[E] included in this CAPA, when [NV]errors[E] are not being [PV]identified[E] in your interim processes.\\n \\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] specific [PV]steps[E] you are [PV]taking[E] to [PV]address[E] the products that may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your CAPA program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\n \\n2.    Failure to adequately [PV]ensure[E] that when the [PV]results[E] of a [PV]process[E] cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test that the [PV]process[E] shall be validated with a [PV]high[E] degree of assurance and approved according to [PV]established[E] procedure, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a).\\nYour [PV]firm[E] has not [PV]established[E] that the (b)(4) of a (b)(4) [PV]constitutes[E] a greater challenge to (b)(4) than the (b)(4) or (b)(4). Specifically, in your firm’s Zimmer Biomet “SUMMARY REPORT” of April 18, 2018, states on [PV]page[E] (b)(4)section 8.4.2.2.2, that: \\n(b)(4)\\n \\nHowever, it is [NV]unclear[E] if [PV]establishing[E] (b)(4), alone, conveys equivalent [PV]process[E] lethality. (b)(4) may be [PV]established[E] during the conditioning and exposure phases, however [NV]effective[E] (b)(4) occurs only during the exposure phase. It [NV]remains[E] [NV]unclear[E] whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) were adequately evaluated for [PV]process[E] lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4). This is especially of [NV]concern[E] since the (b)(4) are [PV]described[E] as [PV]solid[E] in construction; typically [PV]meaning[E] (b)(4).\\n \\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm’s [PV]ability[E] to evaluate whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) for [PV]process[E] lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4) because it is [NV]unclear[E] if excluding these (b)(4) from testing is justified.\\n \\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] is [PV]taking[E] for products that are [PV]currently[E] in distribution and may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your sterilization validation program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\nIn [PV]regards[E] to Sterilization Cycle (b)(4), it is [NV]unclear[E] if the (b)(4) of (b)(4) [PV]might[E] additionally [NV]impede[E] (b)(4) in the (b)(4). Specifically, in the protocol for Cycle (b)(4), “LOADING CONFIGURATION” Section 2, states: “(b)(4).” This portrays a [NV]load[E] configuration [PV]consisting[E] of (b)(4); all [PV]consisting[E] of (b)(4). This indicates (b)(4) with (b)(4), with the [PV]mass[E] of (b)(4). Product in the (b)(4) may [PV]present[E] this as an [PV]additional[E] (b)(4) challenge.\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm’s [PV]ability[E] to [PV]perform[E] microbiological challenge testing. It is [NV]unclear[E] which location(s), within (b)(4), and among (b)(4), [PV]constitutes[E] the worst-case challenge in the [NV]load[E] configuration for sterilization.\\n \\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] is [PV]taking[E] for products that are [PV]currently[E] in distribution and may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your sterilization validation program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\n \\n3.    Failure to develop, conduct, control and monitor [PV]production[E] [PV]processes[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that a device confirms to its specifications, including the monitoring and control of [PV]process[E] parameters and device characteristics during production, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(a)(2). During the inspection. we [NV]observed[E] five [NV]separate[E] [NV]operations[E] in which employees on the [PV]production[E] [NV]line[E] were not [PV]following[E] [PV]production[E] procedures adequately. For example:\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) manual cleaning [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] to be cleaning (b)(4), with a nylon brush. This [PV]individual[E] indicated they were on [PV]step[E] (b)(4) of the cleaning procedure, WCLN017 - Work Instruction Clean – (b)(4). The employee had already  (b)(4) and was [PV]using[E] a nylon brush to [NV]remove[E] debris from the devices. The [PV]work[E] [PV]instruction[E] indicated that the (b)(4) and a wire brush was to be [NV]used[E] to [NV]remove[E] debris. A wire brush was not [NV]observed[E] at the [PV]work[E] station. The employee stated they [PV]use[E] a nylon brush, instead of a wire brush, as the wire brush can [NV]scratch[E] the polished surfaces. (the polished surface was previously [PV]covered[E] with the (b)(4).)\\nOn April 17, 2018, an employee was [NV]observed[E] measuring [PV]part[E] (b)(4), for specification (b)(4) as [PV]part[E] of their [NV]line[E] [PV]clearance[E] activities. According to drawing, (b)(4), specification (b)(4) upper limit should [PV]measure[E] (b)(4) with a [PV]tolerance[E] (b)(4). The employee measured this specification (b)(4) for the [PV]first[E] [PV]part[E] as (b)(4) and the [PV]second[E] [PV]part[E] as (b)(4) and stated the [PV]part[E] was “good.” These measurements were not [PV]identified[E] as non-conformances until the operator was directly asked what the specification was and if the parts were conforming.\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) packaging [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] packing finished (b)(4). They were [PV]using[E] a (b)(4)” gauge to [PV]measure[E] the tray seal in the [NV]metal[E] packaging area. Your firm’s Package Requirements - I00051.3 states that the narrowest seal width for Seal Width-Trays is “not less than (b)(4)”.” Your employee stated that the only gauge at her station was the (b)(4)” gauge.\\nOn April 9, 2018, a sterile sealing [PV]process[E] was observed. An employee was [PV]performing[E] sealing [NV]operations[E] [PV]using[E] a (b)(4) sealer. The employee was not [NV]able[E] to [PV]demonstrate[E] how to [PV]measure[E] seal width [PV]using[E] a gauge as required your Package Requirements - I00051.3. The operator [PV]incorrectly[E] measured an [PV]area[E] [PV]outside[E] of the blister package seal.\\nOn April 11, 2018, we [NV]observed[E] the sterile packaging [NV]operation[E] [PV]using[E] Sealer (b)(4). This sealer was [PV]identified[E] as a [PV]legacy[E] sealer whose [PV]process[E] validation was [NV]found[E] to be inadequate. Your [PV]firm[E] has been relying on [PV]appropriate[E] [PV]process[E] monitoring to [PV]justify[E] the continued [PV]use[E] of this sealer. Heat Sealing Parameter Sheet (HSPS) for (b)(4) Sealer provides [PV]instructions[E] for [PV]taking[E] a total of (b)(4) [PV]samples[E] for [PV]process[E] monitoring testing and SOP 28.0.3 Sterile Packaging Sealer Monitoring [PV]step[E] (b)(4), indicates [PV]samples[E] should be [PV]submitted[E] in order to [PV]demonstrate[E] test [PV]results[E] are obtained over the [PV]time[E] the sterile packaging equipment was in operation. However, during the inspection, Your Quality Technician stated he performs seal [PV]integrity[E] testing only on [PV]samples[E] from the (b)(4) and seal [PV]strength[E] testing only on [PV]samples[E] [NV]taken[E] at the (b)(4). \\nThe above [PV]examples[E] were discussed during the inspection as a [NV]failure[E] of [PV]establishing[E] [PV]sufficient[E] [PV]training[E] procedures, so your [PV]response[E] does not [PV]address[E] the above violation. We are [PV]aware[E] that, by (b)(4). However, this [PV]time[E] [PV]frame[E] is inadequate. In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]provide[E] a [PV]detailed[E] description of how you are ensuring that all employees are [PV]currently[E] [PV]performing[E] routine [PV]manufacturing[E] [NV]operations[E] in accordance with required procedures and in accordance with 21 CFR 820.70.\\n \\n4.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] [PV]design[E] validation procedures to [PV]ensure[E] proper [NV]risk[E] analysis is completed, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g). For example:\\nDuring the inspection, we reviewed a Process Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) #PF0700, dated November 2, 2017, as [PV]part[E] of the [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] file for your [PV]comprehensive[E] shoulder implant, (product: XL‐115363). This [PV]review[E] confirmed inconsistencies in the assignment of [PV]potential[E] severity [PV]ratings[E] for hazards [PV]identified[E] during [PV]design[E] review. For example, the [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] of “Compromise of the product Sterility” is [PV]given[E] severity of [PV]scores[E] of “(b)(4)” (necessitates [NV]minor[E] medical intervention) or “(b)(4)” (results in permanent impairment of [PV]body[E] [PV]function[E] or [NV]damage[E] to [PV]body[E] structure/ necessitates [NV]surgical[E] intervention) for different [PV]potential[E] [NV]failure[E] modes. This [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] [PV]regarding[E] sterility was [PV]assigned[E] a [PV]level[E] of “(b)(4)” for (b)(4) [NV]line[E] [PV]items[E] and a [PV]level[E] of “(b)(4)” in (b)(4) [NV]line[E] [PV]items[E] in this PFMECA. Using a severity [PV]level[E] of “(b)(4)” for the [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] of product sterility for all [NV]failure[E] [PV]modes[E] would [PV]result[E] in (b)(4) of the [NV]hazard[E] [PV]lines[E] exceeding the acceptable [PV]level[E] of (b)(4) which would require further mitigation by your firm. \\nYour [PV]response[E] is not adequate to [PV]address[E] the above violation. Your [PV]response[E] indicates that you are [PV]aware[E] of [PV]historical[E] inconsistencies in the assignment of severity [PV]scores[E] for [NV]failure[E] [PV]modes[E] at Zimmer Biomet. We are [PV]aware[E] that you opened CAPA 02719 in July 2016 to remediate all Zimmer’s [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] files as [PV]part[E] of your (b)(4). We [PV]acknowledge[E] you opened CAPA CA04257 on February 7, 2018 to update [NV]risk[E] management files and that this CAPA includes a [PV]plan[E] to remediate and revise all [PV]existing[E] pFMECAS’s under (b)(4) by (b)(4). In previous [PV]correspondence[E] (March 29, 2018), you have also indicated that all [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] files (DHFs) for implants and [PV]instruments[E] will be evaluated and either remediated to current [PV]design[E] control [PV]standards[E] or rationalized and obsoleted by the (b)(4). However, to date, no DHF’s have undergone [NV]complete[E] remediation. (See CAPA 02179 Timeline)\\n \\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] that recent [PV]design[E] [PV]reviews[E] conducted by your [PV]firm[E] under (b)(4) continue to [PV]demonstrate[E] inconsistencies. As discussed in FDA-483 [PV]item[E] 1.C, we also [NV]observed[E] that you have not [NV]taken[E] a plenary “risk based” approach when [PV]performing[E] device [PV]performance[E] [PV]reviews[E] as [PV]part[E] of [PV]design[E] reviews. In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]provide[E] your [PV]plan[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] [PV]work[E] [PV]currently[E] being [PV]performed[E] by (b)(4) has been [PV]consistent[E] and is [NV]capable[E] of providing the required assurance that [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] [PV]reviews[E] are compliant [PV]moving[E] forward.\\n \\n5.    Where environmental [NV]conditions[E] could [PV]reasonably[E] be expected to have an [NV]adverse[E] [PV]effect[E] on product quality, [NV]failure[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures to adequately control these environmental conditions, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(c). For example:\\nDuring our inspection, we [NV]observed[E] that at least forty non-conformance [PV]reports[E] (NCR’s) have been initiated for microbial environmental action-limit excursions in controlled [PV]areas[E] since March 17, 2017. Twenty-two of these NCR's did not [PV]include[E] an investigation into the cause of the excursion when [PV]action[E] levels were exceeded. For example, NCR 12185873 dated October 20, 2017 [PV]noted[E] a microbial surface [PV]plate[E] exceeded the [PV]action[E] limit. The NCR did not [PV]include[E] any investigation as to a [PV]potential[E] cause, including further identification of the organism. Your SOP 9.5.15 - Environmental Monitoring of Environmentally Controlled Areas, requires that an investigation be conducted immediately when [PV]action[E] levels are exceeded.\\nAlso, on April 9, 2018, we [NV]observed[E] the inspection of shoulder cup implants (item number TI- 115310, under an ISO Class 8 hood at the [NV]end[E] of the (b)(4). We [NV]observed[E] that racks and carriers (mailboxes) [NV]used[E] to [PV]transport[E] [PV]work[E] order documentation for the (b)(4) [PV]process[E] are not sanitized, even though they are routinely sent [PV]back[E] to the hood from the uncontrolled [PV]environment[E] through a pass-through. SOP 9.5.17 - Environmentally Controlled Areas: Cleanroom and Work Environment Practices, requires that all equipment be sanitized prior to [PV]placing[E] it into the environmentally controlled hood. Firm personnel indicated that mailboxes were being reused indefinitely and entering the hood [PV]environment[E] with no evidence of ever being sanitized. \\nYour [PV]response[E] indicates that you have updated your procedures to [PV]ensure[E] investigations into excursions are investigated and documented properly. You also indicated that your [PV]firm[E] has discontinued the [PV]use[E] of mailboxes and opened CAPA CA-04521 to [PV]address[E] employee [PV]practices[E] in this area. We will need to verify during a re-inspection that these [PV]actions[E] are [NV]effective[E] in ensuring environmental [NV]conditions[E] are being controlled properly\\n \\n6.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions, including requirements for analyzing processes, [PV]work[E] operations, concessions, [PV]quality[E] [NV]audit[E] reports, [PV]quality[E] records, [PV]service[E] records, complaints, [PV]returned[E] product, and other [PV]sources[E] of [PV]quality[E] data to [PV]identify[E] [PV]existing[E] and [PV]potential[E] [NV]causes[E] of nonconforming product, or other [PV]quality[E] problems, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(1). For example:\\nYour [PV]firm[E] did not [PV]review[E] [PV]common[E] cause rework (CCR) data as a [PV]quality[E] data source, during the months of January and February 2018, as required by your Work [PV]instruction[E] #WI070002 -  NCR Quality Trending.  In addition, your other procedures - CP01602, SOP016001, and SOP070001 - do not [PV]address[E] CCRs as a [PV]part[E] of your [PV]quality[E] metric [PV]review[E] process.\\nWe [NV]observed[E] that only [PV]one[E] [NV]defect[E] code was [PV]assigned[E] to at least four Non-Conforming Reports (NCR) that were [PV]identified[E] to having multiple deficiencies documented in a [PV]single[E] record. For example, NCR12197758, NCR12226291, NCR12220917 and NCR12177720.\\nYour corrective [PV]action[E] cannot be assessed at this time. Your [PV]response[E] states that you will be revising your SOPs and [PV]work[E] [PV]instructions[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that CCR data will be reviewed. We also [PV]understand[E] that you are updating your (b)(4) system to [PV]improve[E] your [PV]ability[E] to [PV]trend[E] NCRs with multiple [NV]defect[E] codes.  In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, [PV]please[E] [PV]provide[E] your revised SOPs and [PV]work[E] instructions.\\n \\nYour [PV]firm[E] should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]addressed[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in regulatory [PV]action[E] being initiated  by  the  FDA  without  further notice. These [PV]actions[E] include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, [NV]federal[E] [NV]agencies[E] may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may [PV]take[E] this [PV]information[E] into [PV]account[E] when considering the [PV]award[E] of contracts. Additionally, premarket [PV]approval[E] applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation [NV]violations[E] are [PV]reasonably[E] related will not be approved until the [NV]violations[E] have been corrected. Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the [NV]violations[E] related to the subject devices have been corrected.\\n \\nPlease notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen business [PV]days[E] from the [PV]date[E] you [PV]receive[E] this [PV]letter[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] has [NV]taken[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [PV]noted[E] violations, as [PV]well[E] as an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and/or corrective [PV]actions[E] (which must [PV]address[E] systemic problems) that your [PV]firm[E] has taken.

       "9     Dear Mr. Vázquez Borrero:\\n \\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your [PV]food[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]facility[E] located at Calle Guadalupe # 62, Ponce, Puerto Rico, on May 21, 2018 through June 01, 2018. Our inspection [PV]found[E] you have repeat [NV]violations[E] of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations in manufacturing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] human food, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 110.[1[i]] These [NV]violations[E] [PV]cause[E] your [PV]food[E] product(s) to be adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or [PV]held[E] under insanitary [NV]conditions[E] whereby they may have [PV]become[E] contaminated with filth, or may have been rendered injurious to health. You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA regulations in the CFR through [PV]links[E] in FDA's [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\n \\nDuring our inspection of your facility, our investigator’s [PV]observations[E] were [PV]noted[E] on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, [NV]issued[E] to you on June 01, 2018.\\n \\nThe [PV]significant[E] CGMP [NV]violations[E] were as follows:\\n \\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]take[E] [PV]effective[E] [PV]measures[E] to [NV]exclude[E] pests from the [PV]processing[E] [PV]areas[E] and to protect against [NV]contamination[E] of [PV]food[E] on the premises by pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.35(c). Specifically, on 05/21/2018 and 05/22/2018 our investigator [NV]observed[E] [NV]dead[E] roaches’ [PV]parts[E] too numerous to count in your firm's warehouse [PV]floor[E] next to [PV]ambient[E] temperature [PV]raw[E] materials such as sodium benzoate, [NV]dry[E] onions, garlic granules, and oregano. You were previously [NV]cited[E] for the same or similar [NV]violation[E] during the 2009 and 2015 inspections.\\n \\n2.    Your [PV]firm[E] [NV]failed[E] to [PV]take[E] all [PV]reasonable[E] precautions to [PV]ensure[E] that [PV]production[E] procedures do not contribute to [NV]contamination[E] from any source, as required by 21 CFR 110.80. Specifically, during the inspection our investigator [NV]observed[E] while [PV]manufacturing[E] various products with Lot No. 9450, such as 'Sofrito Excelencia' (Condiment Mix) and 'Ajo Puro' (Raw Grounded Garlic) the following:\\nEmployees in the [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]area[E] where re-using disposable [PV]items[E] as utensils. These were at least five (5) [NV]empty[E] plastic bleach containers that were [NV]cut[E] in halves and were being re-used as scoops and funnels for collecting and/or dispensing ingredients, [PV]processing[E] water, and finished products [PV]filling[E] step.\\nAir extractor [PV]screen[E] in the [PV]production[E] [PV]area[E] was [NV]filthy[E] and dusty, potentially [PV]allowing[E] the [NV]falling[E] of [NV]dust[E] and [NV]dirt[E] into in-process products and uncovered [PV]raw[E] ingredients.\\nA [PV]pair[E] of [PV]rubber[E] gloves [NV]used[E] for cleaning [PV]purposes[E] were [NV]hanging[E] [PV]right[E] above exposed 'Ajo Puro' (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished product. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections. \\n3.    You must [PV]store[E] [PV]raw[E] materials in a [PV]manner[E] that protects against contamination, as required by 21 CFR 110.80(a)(1). Specifically, on 05/21/2018 and 05/22/2018, our investigator observed:\\nIngredients such as [NV]dry[E] onions, garlic, oregano, citric acid, and sodium benzoate stored in the [PV]ambient[E] temperature [PV]area[E] on [PV]top[E] of soiled and [NV]dirty[E] pallets. Additionally, the [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] dusty, which could potentially [NV]contaminate[E] ingredients.\\nIngredients such as [PV]red[E] peppers and [PV]green[E] peppers stored in the refrigerator [PV]area[E] on pallets against the [PV]foam[E] [PV]type[E] walls. These [PV]foam[E] [PV]type[E] walls had [NV]missing[E] [PV]sections[E] and were soiled with what appears to be mold. In addition, the [PV]foam[E] [PV]type[E] ceiling was [NV]missing[E] [PV]sections[E] and soiled with what appears to be mold.\\nPackaging cardboard [PV]boxes[E] were stored inside your non-functional and [NV]dirty[E] refrigerator and it had soiled walls and damaged ceiling areas.\\nPreservatives ingredients such as salt, sodium benzoate, and citric [NV]acid[E] [PV]placed[E] in your [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]area[E] were not properly labeled. In addition, these ingredients were stored in [NV]filthy[E] containers and were [NV]kept[E] un-covered while not in use. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2010 and 2015 inspections. \\n4.    You [NV]failed[E] to properly [PV]store[E] equipment, [NV]remove[E] [NV]litter[E] and waste, and [NV]cut[E] weeds or [PV]grass[E] within the [PV]immediate[E] vicinity of the [PV]plant[E] [PV]building[E] that may [PV]constitute[E] an attractant, breeding place, or harborage for pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.20(a)(1). Specifically, our investigator [NV]observed[E] your firm's warehouse area, where packaging plastic bowls, plastic lids, and [NV]glass[E] jar containers were stored, was also [NV]used[E] to [PV]store[E] [NV]waste[E] material, had at least forty (40) not-in-use refrigerators, [PV]one[E] (1) not-in-use forklift, [PV]one[E] (1) not-in-use 300 gallons’ stainless steel tank, and [NV]old[E] carton boxes. In addition, our investigator [NV]observed[E] that an approximately 100 [NV]square[E] [PV]feet[E] [PV]area[E] of the ceiling panels installed in your firm's warehouse were [NV]detached[E] from the ceiling leaving openings that [PV]provide[E] a [PV]potential[E] breeding [PV]place[E] for pests. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections.\\n \\n5.    The procedures [NV]used[E] for cleaning and sanitizing of utensils must [PV]provide[E] adequate cleaning and sanitizing treatment as required by 21 CFR 110.35(d)(5). Specifically,\\nThe three (3)-compartment sink [NV]used[E] to wash and sanitize [NV]glass[E] jars re-used from [PV]returned[E] products was not set up in the [PV]correct[E] sequence of wash-rinse-sanitize. In addition, your [PV]firm[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] cleaning [PV]area[E] does not have a three (3)-compartment sink and utensils are not properly cleaned while [PV]manufacturing[E] is in progress.\\nOn 05/21/2018 and 05/22/2018, our investigator [NV]observed[E] that plastic utensils were [NV]kept[E] inside this [PV]single[E] compartment sink and were being cleaned with [PV]water[E] and [PV]soap[E] alone. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2015 inspection. \\n6.    Your [PV]firm[E] [NV]failed[E] to [PV]provide[E] adequate screening or other protection against pests as required by 21 CFR 110.20(b)(7).  Specifically, our investigator [NV]observed[E] [PV]windows[E] in [PV]processing[E] [PV]area[E] did not have any [PV]type[E] of screening and doors [PV]leading[E] to the receiving and/or dispatching of [PV]raw[E] materials and finished products have a gap of approximately four (4) inches wide at the bottom. A [PV]second[E] [PV]door[E] connecting the exterior of the [PV]firm[E] with this warehouse had a gap of approximately [PV]two[E] (2) inches wide at the bottom. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009 and 2015 inspections. \\n \\n7.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] buildings, fixtures or other physical [PV]facilities[E] in a [PV]sanitary[E] [NV]condition[E] as required by 21 CFR 110.35(a). Specifically, our investigator [NV]observed[E] that the [PV]floors[E] in your [PV]processing[E] [PV]area[E] are not constructed from a [PV]material[E] that could be easily cleaned and [NV]kept[E] clean. Gaps in between [PV]floor[E] tiles had accumulated [NV]dirt[E] and [PV]black[E] [NV]stains[E] that appeared to be mold. In addition, walls in the [PV]processing[E] [PV]area[E] had [PV]sections[E] of [NV]missing[E] tiles and [PV]showed[E] presence of what appeared to be mold. During the inspection, your [PV]firm[E] was formulating 'Sofrito' (Condiment Mix) and 'Ajo' (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished products. (Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009, 2010, and 2015 inspections).\\n \\nWe note that you have not provided a [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] to the Form FDA 483, Investigator Observations, [NV]issued[E] to you on June 01, 2018. Please be [PV]aware[E] that without a [PV]written[E] response, we are [NV]unable[E] to [PV]assess[E] your [PV]understanding[E] of the [PV]observations[E] and any [PV]potential[E] corrective [PV]actions[E] to voluntarily comply with applicable regulations.\\n \\nIn addition, we have [PV]determined[E] that your [PV]facility[E] is [PV]subject[E] to the biennial registration renewal requirement in § 415(a)(3) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350d(a)(3), which requires submission of a renewal registration during the [NV]period[E] [PV]beginning[E] on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, and our implementing regulation at 21 CFR Part 1, Subpart H. During the current inspection of your facility, you were advised of this requirement.  Failure to re-register a [PV]facility[E] is a prohibited act under § 301(dd) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331 (dd).  Our [PV]records[E] indicate that, to date, this [PV]facility[E] has not been re-registered with FDA.\\n \\nAs a [PV]responsible[E] official of a [PV]facility[E] that manufactures/processes, packs, or [PV]holds[E] [PV]food[E] for human or [PV]animal[E] [PV]consumption[E] in the United States, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring that your overall [NV]operation[E] and the products you distribute are in compliance with the law.\\n \\nWe request you register your [PV]facility[E] with FDA within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from receipt of this letter. Registration may be [PV]accomplished[E] on-line at http://www.access.fda.gov. We strongly encourage the use of electronic registration because it will [PV]result[E] in an automatic confirmation of registration and automatic issuance of a registration number. Alternatively, you may register the [PV]facility[E] by [PV]mail[E] or fax (e.g., if you do not have [PV]reasonable[E] access to the Internet) [PV]using[E] FDA’s [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] registration form, Form FDA 3537. This [PV]form[E] may be obtained by calling the FDA Industry Systems Help Desk at 1-800-216-7331 or 301-575-0156, or by [PV]writing[E] to the Agency at the [PV]following[E] address:\\n \\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, HFS-681\\n5600 Fishers Lane\\nRockville, MD 20857\\n \\nWhen completed, the [PV]form[E] may be faxed to (301) 210-0247 or mailed to the [PV]address[E] above. FDA will [PV]process[E] registrations [PV]submitted[E] by [PV]mail[E] or fax and [PV]provide[E] a facility’s registration number [PV]using[E] the same [PV]method[E] [NV]used[E] to [PV]submit[E] the registration to FDA.\\n \\nThis [PV]letter[E] is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the [NV]violations[E] at your facility. It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and in the Inspectional Observations, Form FDA 483, [NV]issued[E] at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of [PV]serious[E] [NV]problems[E] in your firm’s [PV]manufacturing[E] systems. You should investigate and [PV]determine[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] and [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]actions[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] to bring your products into compliance. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further [PV]notice[E] including [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\n \\nSection 743 of the Act, [21 USC 379j-31], authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA’s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, [21 USC 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility.  The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any re-inspection-related costs.\\n \\nPlease notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from receipt of this [PV]letter[E] as to the specific [PV]steps[E] you have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] the stated violations, including an [PV]explanation[E] of each [PV]step[E] being [NV]taken[E] to [PV]identify[E] [NV]violations[E] and [PV]make[E] corrections to [PV]ensure[E] that similar [NV]violations[E] will not recur. In your response, you should [PV]include[E] documentation, including copies of records, photographs or other [NV]useful[E] [PV]information[E] that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in [NV]violation[E] of the Act, [PV]include[E] your reasoning and any supporting [PV]information[E] for our consideration. If corrective [PV]actions[E] cannot be completed within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] [PV]frame[E] within which the corrections will be implemented.\\n \\nYour [PV]reply[E] should be [PV]directed[E] to District Director, Food and Drug Administration, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223.

       "10    James G. Nesbitt, Owner\\n2180 Piney Grove Loop Road\\nOlivehill, Tennessee 38475\\n \\nDear Mr. Nesbitt:\\n \\nOn March 13 and 22, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an investigation of your [PV]cattle[E] operation, located at 2108 Piney Grove Loop Road, Olivehill, Tennessee, as a [PV]follow[E] up to a sulfamethazine [NV]residue[E] that was [PV]found[E] in a slaughtered bull. This [PV]letter[E] notifies you of the [NV]violations[E] of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that we [PV]found[E] during our investigation of your operation. You can [PV]find[E] the Act and its associated regulations through [PV]links[E] on FDA’s Internet web [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov. \\n \\nWe [PV]found[E] that you [PV]hold[E] [PV]animals[E] under [NV]conditions[E] that are so [NV]inadequate[E] that medicated [PV]animals[E] [PV]bearing[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] drug residues are [PV]likely[E] to [PV]enter[E] the [PV]food[E] supply. You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] treatment [PV]records[E] and you [NV]failed[E] to [PV]identify[E] [PV]animals[E] transported and [PV]delivered[E] for sale. Food from [PV]animals[E] [PV]held[E] under such [NV]conditions[E] is adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 342(a)(4).\\n \\nWe also [PV]found[E] that you adulterated the new [PV]animal[E] drug Sustain III® Bolus (sulfamethazine, NADA 120-615). Specifically, our investigation revealed that you did not [PV]use[E] this drug as directed by its approved labeling. Use of this drug in this [PV]manner[E] is an extralabel use. See Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations Part 530.3(a) (21 C.F.R. § 530.3(a)).\\n \\nThe extralabel [PV]use[E] of approved [PV]animal[E] or human [NV]drugs[E] in [PV]animals[E] is [PV]allowed[E] under the FD&C Act only if the extralabel [PV]use[E] complies with [PV]sections[E] 512(a)(4) and (5) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 360b(a)(4) and (5), and 21 CFR Part 530, including that the [PV]use[E] must be by or on the [PV]lawful[E] order of a licensed [PV]veterinarian[E] within the [PV]context[E] of a [PV]valid[E] veterinarian/client/patient relationship. \\n \\nDuring our investigation, you [PV]admitted[E] to administering Sustain III®, an over the counter (OTC) product, to a [PV]black[E] [NV]bull[E] without [PV]following[E] the indications for [PV]use[E] and the route of administration, as stated in the approved labeling. Under your supervision, this [PV]black[E] [NV]bull[E] was [PV]treated[E] with Sustain III® for “being [NV]old[E] and slow” by crushing and mixing three (3) boluses of Sustain III® to feed. Sustain III® is not approved for these conditions. Additionally, the label states in [PV]part[E] “…care should be [NV]taken[E] not to crush the bolus”. Using OTC products in an extralabel [PV]manner[E] requires a lawfully [PV]written[E] order from a veterinarian. Your extralabel [PV]use[E] of Sustain III® was not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, in violation of 21 CFR § 530.11(a) as [NV]illegal[E] extralabel [PV]use[E] of a drug.   \\n \\nBecause your [PV]use[E] of this drug was not in conformance with its approved labeling and did not comply with 21 CFR Part 530, you caused the drug to be [NV]unsafe[E] under [PV]section[E] 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).\\n \\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a [PV]producer[E] of [PV]animals[E] [PV]offered[E] for [PV]use[E] as food, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring that your overall [NV]operation[E] and the [PV]food[E] you distribute is in compliance with the law.\\n \\nYou should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]described[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and to [PV]establish[E] procedures to [PV]ensure[E] that these [NV]violations[E] do not recur. Failure to do so may [PV]result[E] in regulatory [PV]action[E] without further [PV]notice[E] such as [NV]seizure[E] and/or injunction. \\n \\nYou should notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] of the [PV]steps[E] you have [NV]taken[E] to bring your [PV]firm[E] into compliance with the law within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receiving this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] each [PV]step[E] that has been [NV]taken[E] or will be [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] and prevent their recurrence. If corrective [PV]action[E] cannot be completed within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receiving this letter, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] [PV]frame[E] within which the corrections will be completed. Please [PV]include[E] copies of any [PV]available[E] documentation demonstrating that corrections have been made.\\n \\nYour [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] should be [PV]sent[E] to Kimberly A. Dutzek, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 404 BNA Drive, Building 200, Suite 500, Nashville, Tennessee 37217.

Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(rr)), as amended by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including e-liquids, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 387a(b)).\\\\n \\\\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http:\\\\/\\\\/www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquids violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)) because they are directed to consumers and conveys, misleads, or would mislead consumers into believing that the tobacco products are approved by FDA. \\\\n \\\\nAdditionally, FDA has determined that the products E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 355(a)) and misbranded under sections 502(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 352(a), (f)(1), and (f)(2)). \\\\n \\\\nSection 301(tt) Violation\\\\n \\\\nFDA has determined that statements or representations made on the website http:\\\\/\\\\/www.hellocig.com regarding certain e-liquid products violates section 301(tt) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 331(tt)), which prohibits:\\\\n \\\\n\\\\u201c[m]aking any express or implied statement or representation directed to consumers with respect to a tobacco product, in a label or labeling or through the media or advertising, that either conveys, or misleads or would mislead consumers into believing, that\\\\u2014\\\\n(1)   the product is approved by the Food and Drug Administration;\\\\n(2)   the Food and Drug Administration deems the product to be safe for use by consumers;\\\\n(3)   the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration for use by consumers; or\\\\n(4)   the product is safe or less harmful by virtue of\\\\u2014\\\\n(A)  its regulation or inspection by the Food and Drug Administration; or\\\\n(B)  its compliance with regulatory requirements set by the Food and Drug Administration\\\\u2026\\\\u201d\\\\n \\\\nSpecifically, certain e-liquid products are sold or distributed on the website to consumers in the United States with the statements: \\\\u201c99.9% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA,\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cThe 100% pure nicotine is FDA approved product with FDA\\\\u201d: DIY Pure Nicotine 5mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 10mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 30mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 60mL, DIY Pure Nicotine 250mL, and DIY Pure Nicotine 1L.

Section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product is misbranded if its \\\\u201clabeling is false or misleading in any particular.\\\\u201d Section 903(a)(7) of the FD&C Act provides that a tobacco product distributed or offered for sale in any State is misbranded if its \\\\u201cadvertising is false or misleading in any particular.\\\\u201d These e-liquid products are misbranded under section 903(a)(1) of the FD&C Act and\\\\/or section 903(a)(7)(A) of the FD&C Act as their labeling or advertising is false or misleading because it makes the statement or representation that the products are FDA approved.\\\\n                                    \\\\nUnapproved New Drug Violations\\\\n \\\\nThe E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are \\\\u201cdrugs\\\\u201d as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(g)(1)(B)), because they are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and\\\\/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(g)(1)(C)) because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are available for purchase on the website, www.hellocig.com. Examples of claims for these products observed on the website that establish the intended uses of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:\\\\n \\\\n\\\\u201cE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid\\\\u201d with an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\u201cE-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid\\\\u201d with an image of an Acomplia container and tablets.\\\\n \\\\n\\\\u201cE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cE-Rimonobant HelloCig E-Liquid\\\\u201d are sold on the website under the \\\\u201cHC Healthcare Flavor\\\\u201d category.\\\\n \\\\nAn advertisement for \\\\u201cE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid\\\\u201d on Twitter and Tumblr state \\\\u201cCialis\\\\u201d with an image of the product and a partially undressed couple embracing. The caption states, \\\\u201cWOOOOW, Have you tried our E-Cialis? It is amazing LOL Check out: http:\\\\/\\\\/www.hellocig.com\\\\/e-cialis-hellocig-e-liquid-250ml\\\\u201d\\\\n \\\\nCialis is the tradename of the FDA-approved prescription drug product used to treat erectile dysfunction. Using the tradename of the drug product Cialis and including an image of a Cialis bottle and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that this product is intended to improve sexual capacity for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction. Similarly, Acomplia is the tradename of the anti-obesity drug product in Europe. Using the tradename of the drug product Acomplia and including an image of the Acomplia container and tablets next to the product on your website suggests that the product is intended to treat obesity. \\\\n \\\\nAdditionally, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra\\\\u2122, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Tadalafil is also a PDE-5 inhibitor and is the active ingredient in Cialis\\\\u2122, another FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat ED. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products is further evidence that these products are intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and\\\\/or under because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\\\n \\\\nThese products are \\\\u201cnew drugs\\\\u201d within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C \\\\u00a7 321(p)) because they are not generally recognized among scientific experts as safe and effective for their labeled uses. As new drugs, E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C \\\\u00a7 355(a)). E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid or E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid are not the subject of FDA-approved applications, and therefore, the current marketing of these products violates section 505(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C \\\\u00a7 355(a)). Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under Section 301(d) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(d)).  \\\\n \\\\nMisbranded Drugs\\\\n \\\\nAs described above, we confirmed through laboratory analysis that your E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid contained undeclared sildenafil and tadalafil. \\\\n \\\\nUnder section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 352(a)), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  According to section 201(n) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(n)), in determining whether the labeling or advertising \\\\u201cis misleading, there shall be taken into account (among other things) not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in the light of such representations . . ..\\\\u201d The labeling for your E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid fail to declare that the products contain the PDE-5 inhibitors listed above. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose the presence of the PDE-5 inhibitors renders your products\\\\u2019 labeling false or misleading. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 352(a)). \\\\n \\\\nE-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid contain one or more PDE-5 inhibitors. All PDE-5 inhibitors that have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a licensed practitioner to administer such drugs. Therefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 353(b)(1)(A)), because, in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary for their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs.\\\\n \\\\nTherefore, E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 352(f)(1)), because their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s). \\\\u201cAdequate directions for use\\\\u201d means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.  Because, by definition, prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner, section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 353(b)(1)A)],  adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use them safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs which bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson (21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products, they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Consequently, their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 352(f)(1)).\\\\n \\\\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 352(f)(2)) in that the products\\\\u2019 labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events. \\\\n \\\\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(a)). \\\\n \\\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\\\n \\\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately correct the violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco and drug products into compliance with the FD&C Act. \\\\n \\\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco and drug products and all related labeling and\\\\/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Consequently, their labeling [NV]fails[E] to [PV]bear[E] adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 352(f)(1)).\\\\n \\\\nThe undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid also [PV]cause[E] these products to be misbranded under [PV]section[E] 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 352(f)(2)) in that the products\\\\u2019 labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.   As previously noted, there is [PV]potential[E] for [NV]adverse[E] [PV]events[E] associated with the [PV]use[E] of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who [PV]use[E] E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid would be [NV]unaware[E] of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and [PV]placed[E] at [NV]risk[E] for their associated [NV]adverse[E] events. \\\\n \\\\nYour E-Rimonabant HelloCig E-Liquid and E-Cialis HelloCig E-Liquid products are misbranded for all of the before-stated reasons. The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(a)). \\\\n \\\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\\\n \\\\nThe [NV]violations[E] discussed in this [PV]letter[E] do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should immediately [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] that are referenced above, as [PV]well[E] as [NV]violations[E] that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and [PV]take[E] any necessary [PV]actions[E] to bring your [NV]tobacco[E] and drug products into compliance with the FD&C Act. \\\\n \\\\nIt is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [NV]tobacco[E] and drug products and all related labeling and\\\\/or [PV]advertising[E] on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, [PV]social[E] networking, or search [PV]engine[E] websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to [PV]ensure[E] [PV]full[E] compliance with the FD&C Act may [PV]result[E] in FDA initiating further [PV]action[E] without notice, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, criminal prosecution, seizure, and\\\\/or injunction. Please note that adulterated and misbranded [NV]tobacco[E] products [PV]offered[E] for [PV]import[E] into the United States are [PV]subject[E] to [NV]detention[E] and [NV]refusal[E] of admission.\\\\n \\\\nPlease [PV]submit[E] a [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] to this [PV]letter[E] within 15 [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from the [PV]date[E] of receipt [PV]describing[E] your corrective actions, including the [PV]dates[E] on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and\\\\/or distribution of these [NV]tobacco[E] products and your [PV]plan[E] for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

During this inspection FDA documented significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may find the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA\\\\u2019s regulations through links on the FDA\\\\u2019s website at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition, on two occasions you manufactured and distributed animal food that was intended to be non-medicated but was determined to contain animal drugs by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture\\\\u2019s (NDA) surveillance sampling. Specifically:\\\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your \\\\u201cSandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00\\\\u201d lot code #10\\\\/02\\\\/2017 and found monensin at 4.2 parts per million or 4 grams\\\\/ton. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\\\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d lot code #11\\\\/22\\\\/2017 and found chlortetracycline at 57 grams\\\\/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for use in swine food, your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d is not labeled to contain any animal drugs.  \\\\n \\\\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\\\n \\\\nFDA\\\\u2019s inspection in May 2018 documented significant deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We acknowledge your written response dated June 5, 2018; however, your response does not adequately address the deviations, as discussed below. \\\\n \\\\n1.    You failed to adequately investigate and implement corrective actions when laboratory assays of drug components indicated that medicated feed was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such records on the premises for one year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your \\\\u201cSandhills Select Horse Feed\\\\u201d, lot code #10\\\\/02\\\\/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d lot code #11\\\\/22\\\\/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated animal foods to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no records were provided of an investigation or corrective actions regarding this incident. \\\\n \\\\nYour June 5, 2018 written response discusses your corrective actions for the Sandhills Select Horse feed and the (b)(4) non-medicated animal foods which NDA sampled and found to contain new animal drugs. Your response stated that you sent retained samples for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and trained employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your response does not indicate you have investigated the cause of these two lab results. These results could have a variety of causes from situations other than carryover due to improper sequencing. For example, carryover may occur because no flush was implemented, or an ineffective flush occurred. In addition, the presence of drugs in a non-medicated feed may result from an operator or machine error that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective actions do not identify the root cause of the incidents and do not address the other possible ways the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\\\n \\\\n2.        You failed to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated feeds intended for use in the manufacture of medicated feeds to aid in assuring the identity, strength, quality and purity of these drug sources as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we found multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, used to further manufacture animal food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the following new animal drugs were not recorded in your drug inventory:\\\\n \\\\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated feed - (b)(4) bags\\\\n \\\\nYour June 5, 2018 written response states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted additional training to ensure all new animal drugs are included on your drug records. You included the SOP signed by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the effectiveness of your SOP and training at our next inspection.\\\\n \\\\nConclusion\\\\n \\\\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition to the incidents listed above, in June 2018 your firm bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for internal use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently fed to your customer\\\\u2019s cattle and resulted in the death of four cows and illness of two cows. We acknowledge that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and submitted a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued lack of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\\\n \\\\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA\\\\u2019s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\\\n \\\\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR part 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subpart B. These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, please see FDA\\\\u2019s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM499200.pdf.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  Please see our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals at:\\\\nhttps:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM592870.pdf.\\\\n \\\\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations from occurring again. More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken. If your firm\\\\u2019s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\\\n \\\\nPlease send your written response to Danial S. Hutchison, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 8050 Marshall Dr., Suite 205, Lenexa, KS 66214.

Kesler, CEO\\\\/President\\\\nFarmers\\\\/Ranchers Cooperative Association of Ainsworth\\\\n224 S Main Street\\\\nAinsworth, NE 69210\\\\n \\\\n \\\\nDear Ms. Kesler,\\\\n \\\\nFDA conducted an inspection on May 21 and 22, 2018 of your non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] located at 224 S, Main Street, Ainsworth, NE. During this inspection FDA documented [PV]significant[E] deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively. You may [PV]find[E] the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and FDA\\\\u2019s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA\\\\u2019s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition, on [PV]two[E] occasions you manufactured and distributed [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] that was intended to be non-medicated but was [PV]determined[E] to [PV]contain[E] [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] by the Nebraska Department of Agriculture\\\\u2019s (NDA) [NV]surveillance[E] sampling. Specifically:\\\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your \\\\u201cSandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00\\\\u201d [PV]lot[E] code #10\\\\/02\\\\/2017 and [PV]found[E] monensin at 4.2 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] or 4 grams\\\\/ton. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] adverse [NV]health[E] consequences or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\\\n2.    NDA sampled and analyzed your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d [PV]lot[E] code #11\\\\/22\\\\/2017 and [PV]found[E] chlortetracycline at 57 grams\\\\/ton. Although chlortetracycline is approved for [PV]use[E] in [NV]swine[E] food, your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d is not labeled to [PV]contain[E] any [PV]animal[E] drugs.  \\\\n \\\\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\\\n \\\\nFDA\\\\u2019s inspection in May 2018 documented [PV]significant[E] deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We [PV]acknowledge[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] dated June 5, 2018; however, your [PV]response[E] does not adequately [PV]address[E] the deviations, as discussed below. \\\\n \\\\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to adequately investigate and implement corrective [PV]actions[E] when laboratory assays of drug [PV]components[E] indicated that medicated [PV]feed[E] was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such [PV]records[E] on the premises for [PV]one[E] year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your \\\\u201cSandhills Select Horse Feed\\\\u201d, [PV]lot[E] code #10\\\\/02\\\\/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d [PV]lot[E] code #11\\\\/22\\\\/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no [PV]records[E] were provided of an investigation or corrective [PV]actions[E] regarding this incident. \\\\n \\\\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] discusses your corrective [PV]actions[E] for the Sandhills Select Horse [PV]feed[E] and the (b)(4) non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] which NDA sampled and [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] new [PV]animal[E] drugs. Your [PV]response[E] stated that you [PV]sent[E] retained [PV]samples[E] for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and [PV]trained[E] employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your [PV]response[E] does not indicate you have investigated the [PV]cause[E] of these [PV]two[E] lab results. These [PV]results[E] could have a [PV]variety[E] of [NV]causes[E] from [PV]situations[E] other than carryover due to [NV]improper[E] sequencing. For example, carryover may [PV]occur[E] because no flush was implemented, or an [PV]ineffective[E] flush occurred. In addition, the presence of [NV]drugs[E] in a non-medicated [PV]feed[E] may [PV]result[E] from an operator or [PV]machine[E] [NV]error[E] that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective [PV]actions[E] do not [PV]identify[E] the root [PV]cause[E] of the incidents and do not [PV]address[E] the other [PV]possible[E] [PV]ways[E] the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\\\n \\\\n2.        You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated [PV]feeds[E] intended for [PV]use[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of medicated [PV]feeds[E] to [PV]aid[E] in assuring the identity, strength, [PV]quality[E] and [PV]purity[E] of these drug [PV]sources[E] as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we [PV]found[E] multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, [NV]used[E] to further [PV]manufacture[E] [PV]animal[E] food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the [PV]following[E] new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] were not [PV]recorded[E] in your drug inventory:\\\\n \\\\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\\\nc.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\\\nd.    (b)(4) (Ractopamine HCL) Lot# (b)(4) Type A medicated article - (b)(4) bags (25 lbs)\\\\ne.    (b)(4) % (Fenbendazole) Lot# (b)(4) Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\\\n \\\\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] states that you have implemented SOPs and conducted [PV]additional[E] [PV]training[E] to [PV]ensure[E] all new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] are included on your drug records. You included the SOP [PV]signed[E] by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the [PV]effectiveness[E] of your SOP and [PV]training[E] at our next inspection.\\\\n \\\\nConclusion\\\\n \\\\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the incidents [PV]listed[E] above, in June 2018 your [PV]firm[E] bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for [PV]internal[E] use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently [PV]fed[E] to your customer\\\\u2019s [PV]cattle[E] and resulted in the [PV]death[E] of four cows and [NV]illness[E] of [PV]two[E] cows. We [PV]acknowledge[E] that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and [PV]submitted[E] a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued [NV]lack[E] of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\\\n \\\\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA\\\\u2019s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\\\n \\\\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B. These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  For more information, [PV]please[E] [PV]see[E] FDA\\\\u2019s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM499200.pdf.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition, you are now [PV]subject[E] to the [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.

During this inspection FDA documented [PV]significant[E] deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 225 [21 CFR 225]. These CGMPs deviations [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(ii)] and Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B)], respectively.

Specifically:\\\\n1.    NDA sampled and analyzed your \\\\u201cSandhills Select Horse Feed G00005-00\\\\u201d [PV]lot[E] code #10\\\\/02\\\\/2017 and [PV]found[E] monensin at 4.2 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] or 4 grams\\\\/ton. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] adverse [NV]health[E] consequences or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\\\n2.

Although chlortetracycline is approved for [PV]use[E] in [NV]swine[E] food, your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d is not labeled to [PV]contain[E] any [PV]animal[E] drugs.  \\\\n \\\\nAdulterated Animal Food - Medicated Feed CGMP Violations\\\\n \\\\nFDA\\\\u2019s inspection in May 2018 documented [PV]significant[E] deviations of the CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR Part 225). We [PV]acknowledge[E] your [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] dated June 5, 2018; however, your [PV]response[E] does not adequately [PV]address[E] the deviations, as discussed below. \\\\n \\\\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to adequately investigate and implement corrective [PV]actions[E] when laboratory assays of drug [PV]components[E] indicated that medicated [PV]feed[E] was not in accordance with permissible limits, and to retain such [PV]records[E] on the premises for [PV]one[E] year as required by 21 CFR. 225.158. You were notified by NDA  that  your \\\\u201cSandhills Select Horse Feed\\\\u201d, [PV]lot[E] code #10\\\\/02\\\\/2017, was contaminated with monensin, and you were notified by your customer, (b)(4) that your \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d [PV]lot[E] code #11\\\\/22\\\\/2017 was contaminated with Chlortetracycline, this caused these non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] to  not be in accordance with the permissible limits. During our inspection no [PV]records[E] were provided of an investigation or corrective [PV]actions[E] regarding this incident. \\\\n \\\\nYour June 5, 2018 [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] discusses your corrective [PV]actions[E] for the Sandhills Select Horse [PV]feed[E] and the (b)(4) non-medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]foods[E] which NDA sampled and [PV]found[E] to [PV]contain[E] new [PV]animal[E] drugs. Your [PV]response[E] stated that you [PV]sent[E] retained [PV]samples[E] for analysis, updated the sequencing chart, and [PV]trained[E] employees on the sequencing chart. However, this is not adequate because your [PV]response[E] does not indicate you have investigated the [PV]cause[E] of these [PV]two[E] lab results. These [PV]results[E] could have a [PV]variety[E] of [NV]causes[E] from [PV]situations[E] other than carryover due to [NV]improper[E] sequencing. For example, carryover may [PV]occur[E] because no flush was implemented, or an [PV]ineffective[E] flush occurred. In addition, the presence of [NV]drugs[E] in a non-medicated [PV]feed[E] may [PV]result[E] from an operator or [PV]machine[E] [NV]error[E] that resulted in the drug being inadvertently added to a non-medicated batch. Your corrective [PV]actions[E] do not [PV]identify[E] the root [PV]cause[E] of the incidents and do not [PV]address[E] the other [PV]possible[E] [PV]ways[E] the incidents could have occurred.                                                                                                         \\\\n \\\\n2.        You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] adequate procedures for the identification, storage, and inventory control (receipt and use) of all Type A medicated articles and Type B medicated [PV]feeds[E] intended for [PV]use[E] in the [PV]manufacture[E] of medicated [PV]feeds[E] to [PV]aid[E] in assuring the identity, strength, [PV]quality[E] and [PV]purity[E] of these drug [PV]sources[E] as required by 21 CFR 225.142. During our inspection, we [PV]found[E] multiple Type A medicated articles or Type B medicated feeds, [NV]used[E] to further [PV]manufacture[E] [PV]animal[E] food, which were not accounted for in your inventory. For example, the [PV]following[E] new [PV]animal[E] [NV]drugs[E] were not [PV]recorded[E] in your drug inventory:\\\\n \\\\na.    (b)(4) (monensin) Lot# (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4) bags (55.1 lbs)\\\\nb.    (b)(4) % Type B medicated [PV]feed[E] - (b)(4) bags\\\\nc.

You included the SOP [PV]signed[E] by your employees. We will evaluate these changes and the [PV]effectiveness[E] of your SOP and [PV]training[E] at our next inspection.\\\\n \\\\nConclusion\\\\n \\\\nThe above is not intended as an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated feed, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring your overall [NV]operations[E] and the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and medicated [PV]feed[E] you [PV]manufacture[E] and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the incidents [PV]listed[E] above, in June 2018 your [PV]firm[E] bagged urea into unmarked bags intended for [PV]internal[E] use, which your employee mistakenly distributed as mono-calcium phosphate. This product was subsequently [PV]fed[E] to your customer\\\\u2019s [PV]cattle[E] and resulted in the [PV]death[E] of four cows and [NV]illness[E] of [PV]two[E] cows. We [PV]acknowledge[E] that upon notification from your customer, you promptly recalled this product and [PV]submitted[E] a Reportable Food Registry (RFR) report. However, this incident further indicates a continued [NV]lack[E] of control over implementing CGMPs in your facility.\\\\n \\\\nSection 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA\\\\u2019s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any reinspection-related costs.\\\\n \\\\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507. Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the FD&C Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B. These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).

Bonovsky\\\\nManager\\\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\\\n \\\\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\\\n \\\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial feed mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in response to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the death of five horses after consuming your custom Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA found through laboratory analysis that your custom Horse Blend 985 contained monensin. Monensin is not approved in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. \\\\n \\\\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 causes it to be unsafe because the animal food containing the new animal drug was not used in conformance with the drug approval as outlined in section 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the animal food containing the new animal drug is adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which cause your non-medicated and medicated animal food to be adulterated as outlined in section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\\\n \\\\nMedicated feed CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may find the Act and FDA\\\\u2019s regulations through links on the FDA\\\\u2019s website at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nAdulterated Animal Food\\\\n \\\\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a sample of your non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The sample analysis found 143 parts per million (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for use in horse food and can cause serious adverse health consequences or death to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may experience health consequence such as tachycardia, ataxia, or gross lesions in cardiac and skeletal muscles after consuming monensin.  As a result, the new animal drug approval for monensin requires the following caution statement to be placed on all formulations containing monensin:  \\\\u201cDo not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,\\\\u201d 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this animal feed containing a new animal drug is unsafe and adulterated because the animal feed and its labeling, distribution, holding, and use does not conform to the approved new animal drug application.[1]\\\\n \\\\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\\\n \\\\nThe violations of the medicated feed CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated animal food manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\\\n \\\\n1.    You failed to establish and use adequate procedures for all equipment used in the production and distribution of medicated feeds to avoid unsafe contamination of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\\\n \\\\nYour batching and mixing operations are inadequate to ensure that your medicated feed does not contaminate other medicated and non-medicated feeds. On June 4, 2018, you manufactured a custom cattle mix containing (b)(4) (monensin). After the manufacture of this medicated feed, it does not appear steps were taken to either flush or clean equipment. The two batches immediately following, a medicated bambermycin custom steer mix and a non-medicated custom Horse Blend 985, were both found to contain monensin. Your facility notes on the batching records the following procedure:  \\\\u201c(b)(4) flush is required for all medicated feed.\\\\u201d  You failed to document that a flush occurred per your procedure. As a result, your facility cannot ensure your flushing procedure was followed after manufacture of a medicated feed. This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm is not documenting on the production record when a flush occurs.\\\\n \\\\nAdditionally, it was noted during this inspection that there is excessive build-up on your horizontal mixer, specifically, inside the drum, on the horizontal ribbon within the drum, on the horizontal ribbon in front of the drum, and on the exit chute to the conveyor belt. Also, it was noted that you did not have a regular cleaning schedule established for the maintenance of this equipment. Excessive build-up and lack of cleaning may contribute to the carry-over of drugs from one batch to another because build-up containing new animal drugs on equipment can dislodge during manufacturing of subsequent batches and contaminate the batch with the new animal drug. \\\\n \\\\n2.    You failed to maintain formula, production, and distribution records to identify the formulation. Records must be maintained which identify the formulation, date of mixing, and date of shipment (if not for own use).  The records shall be adequate to facilitate the recall of specific batches of medicated feed that have been distributed.  Such records shall be retained on the premises for one year following the date of last distribution, 21 CFR 225.202.\\\\n \\\\nYour medicated feed batching records include a space to record the drug name, lot number, and pounds per batch. During a review of your records on June 4, 2018, your production records did not have any entries for the drug name, drug lot number, and amount of drug used in the manufacture of your medicated feed.  This is a repeat violation from the previous inspection where it was noted that your firm failed to document drug lot numbers on the production record when manufacturing medicated feeds.\\\\n \\\\n3.    You failed to identify and store bulk Type B medicated feeds in a manner such that their identity, strength, quality, and purity will be maintained, 21 CFR 225.142.\\\\n \\\\nOur investigator observed several open bulk bays where Type B medicated feeds including pelleted bambermycin and lasalocid were being stored without adequate identification.\\\\n \\\\nTo date, the agency has not received any written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations.\\\\n \\\\nConclusion\\\\n \\\\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a manufacturer of animal food and medicated feed, you are responsible for ensuring your overall operations and the animal food and medicated feed you manufacture and distribute are in compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nSection 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA\\\\u2019s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.\\\\n \\\\n(b)(3)(A)\\\\n \\\\nThe Reportable Food Registry was established by section 1005 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-085) to provide a reliable mechanism to track patterns of adulteration in food to support efforts by FDA to target limited inspection resources to protect the public health.  It requires a responsible party to file a report when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals.\\\\nSuch foods are \\\\u201cReportable Foods.\\\\u201d  The responsible party is the person who submits the registration under section 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 350f(d), for a food facility that is required to register under section 415(a), at which such article of food is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to submit a required report about a reportable food is a prohibited act under section 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(mm).\\\\n \\\\nFurthermore, your facility is now subject to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations found in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a food facility under section 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding medicated feed under 21 CFR 225 are also subject to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding both medicated and non-medicated animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal food facilities that are subject to specific CGMPs, such as medicated feed CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as well as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).  For more information, please see FDA\\\\u2019s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at:  https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/ AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/ GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM499200.pdf.   \\\\n \\\\nIn addition, you are now subject to the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements in 21 CFR 507, subparts C and E, unless an exemption applies, 21 CFR 507.5. According to these requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazards.  The PCQI, or designee, must evaluate identified known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control to significantly minimize or prevent the hazard.  Please see FDA\\\\u2019s draft Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at: https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceCompliance Enforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM592870.pdf.\\\\n \\\\nYou should respond in writing within 15 business days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct these violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again.  More specifically, your response should include documentation of the corrections (including how you intend to address systemic problems) your firm has taken.  If your firm\\\\u2019s planned corrections will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections cannot be completed within 15 business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed.\\\\n \\\\nPlease send your written response to Dianna C. Sonnenburg, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, at 250 Marquette Ave, Suite 600, Minneapolis, MN 55401. If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Mrs. Sonnenburg at (612)

L. Bonovsky\\\\nManager\\\\nGilman Cooperative Creamery Association\\\\n9920 115th Street NE, P.O. Box 7\\\\nGilman, Minnesota 56333\\\\n \\\\nDear Mr. Bonovsky:\\\\n \\\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) conducted an inspection of your commercial [PV]feed[E] mill located at 9920 115th Street NE, Gilman, Minnesota, on July 5, 10, and 24, 2018. This inspection was conducted in [PV]response[E] to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the [PV]death[E] of five horses after consuming your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA [PV]found[E] through laboratory analysis that your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 [PV]contained[E] monensin. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\\\n \\\\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 [NV]causes[E] it to be [NV]unsafe[E] because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug was not [NV]used[E] in conformance with the drug [NV]approval[E] as outlined in [PV]section[E] 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed [NV]violations[E] of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and [PV]section[E] 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\\\n \\\\nMedicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).  You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA\\\\u2019s regulations through [PV]links[E] on the FDA\\\\u2019s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nAdulterated Animal Food\\\\n \\\\nDuring our July 2018 inspection we collected a [PV]sample[E] of your non-medicated [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985, manufactured on June 4, 2018, for drug analysis. The [PV]sample[E] analysis [PV]found[E] 143 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for [PV]use[E] in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may [PV]experience[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequence[E] such as tachycardia, ataxia, or [NV]gross[E] [NV]lesions[E] in [NV]cardiac[E] and [NV]skeletal[E] [PV]muscles[E] after consuming monensin.  As a result, the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug [NV]approval[E] for monensin requires the [PV]following[E] [NV]caution[E] statement to be [PV]placed[E] on all formulations [PV]containing[E] monensin:  \\\\u201cDo not [NV]allow[E] horses or other equines access to [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] monensin.  Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal,\\\\u201d 21 CFR 558.355(d)(6).  Therefore, this [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] a [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is [NV]unsafe[E] and adulterated because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]feed[E] and its labeling, distribution, holding, and [PV]use[E] does not conform to the approved [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug application.[1]\\\\n \\\\nMedicated Feed CGMP Violations\\\\n \\\\nThe [NV]violations[E] of the medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP regulations for non-licensed medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] manufacturers (21 CFR 225.120-220) [PV]observed[E] during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:\\\\n \\\\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]use[E] adequate procedures for all equipment [NV]used[E] in the [PV]production[E] and distribution of medicated [NV]feeds[E] to avoid [NV]unsafe[E] [NV]contamination[E] of medicated and non-medicated feeds, 21 CFR 225.165. \\\\n \\\\nYour batching and mixing [NV]operations[E] are [NV]inadequate[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that your medicated [PV]feed[E] does not [NV]contaminate[E] other medicated and non-medicated feeds.

This inspection was conducted in [PV]response[E] to a Livestock Food Registry (LFR) event, received by FDA on  July 2, 2018, which reported the [PV]death[E] of five horses after consuming your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 manufactured on June 4, 2018. FDA [PV]found[E] through laboratory analysis that your [PV]custom[E] Horse Blend 985 [PV]contained[E] monensin. Monensin is not approved in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. \\\\n \\\\nThe presence of monensin in your Horse Blend 985 [NV]causes[E] it to be [NV]unsafe[E] because the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug was not [NV]used[E] in conformance with the drug [NV]approval[E] as outlined in [PV]section[E] 512(a)(2)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 360b(a)(2)(A)(i).  As a result, the [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]containing[E] the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug is adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii). In addition, our inspection revealed [NV]violations[E] of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for medicated feed, which [PV]cause[E] your non-medicated and medicated [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated as outlined in [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), and [PV]section[E] 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(a)(2)(B), respectively.\\\\n \\\\nMedicated [PV]feed[E] CGMP requirements are in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 225 (21 CFR 225).

The [PV]sample[E] analysis [PV]found[E] 143 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) of monensin in your product. Monensin is not approved for [PV]use[E] in [PV]horse[E] [PV]food[E] and [PV]can[E] [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to horses if consumed. Specifically, horses may [PV]experience[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequence[E] such as tachycardia, ataxia, or [NV]gross[E] [NV]lesions[E] in [NV]cardiac[E] and [NV]skeletal[E] [PV]muscles[E] after consuming monensin.  As a result, the [NV]new[E] [PV]animal[E] drug [NV]approval[E] for monensin requires the [PV]following[E] [NV]caution[E] statement to be [PV]placed[E] on all formulations [PV]containing[E] monensin:  \\\\u201cDo not [NV]allow[E] horses or other equines access to [PV]feed[E] [PV]containing[E] monensin.

It requires a [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] to file a [NV]report[E] when there is a [PV]reasonable[E] [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, an article of [PV]food[E] will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [PV]death[E] to humans or animals.\\\\nSuch [PV]foods[E] are \\\\u201cReportable Foods.\\\\u201d  The [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] is the [PV]person[E] who submits the registration under [PV]section[E] 415(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 350f(d), for a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] that is required to register under [PV]section[E] 415(a), at which such article of [PV]food[E] is manufactured, processed, packed, or held.  Failure to [PV]submit[E] a required [NV]report[E] about a reportable [PV]food[E] is a prohibited act under [PV]section[E] 301(mm) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(mm).\\\\n \\\\nFurthermore, your [PV]facility[E] is now [PV]subject[E] to the Preventive Controls for Animal Food regulations [PV]found[E] in 21 CFR 507.  Facilities that are required to register with FDA as a [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] under [PV]section[E] 415 of the Act and are manufacturing, processing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] medicated [PV]feed[E] under 21 CFR 225 are also [PV]subject[E] to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B.  These regulations [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] both medicated and non-medicated [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [PV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated, 21 CFR 507.1(a)(1)(i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the Act.  Animal [PV]food[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are [PV]subject[E] to specific CGMPs, such as medicated [PV]feed[E] CGMPs, must comply with those requirements as [PV]well[E] as the requirements in 21 CFR 507, subpart B, 21 CFR 507.1(c).

OVERNIGHT DELIVERY\",\"raw\":\"On January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\\\\u201cFDA\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cwe\\\\u201d) received a complaint (\\\\u201cJanuary 24 complaint\\\\u201d) from a consumer who reported the death of two kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens ate your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In response to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic samples collected during the necropsy of one of the kittens that died after eating your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten\\\\u2019s spleen, kidney, and small intestine was identical to the Salmonella isolated from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the source of illness.  \\\\n \\\\nAlso, in response to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your raw pet food manufacturing facility at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was positive for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product sample of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The sample was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was found positive for Salmonella.  \\\\n \\\\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic bacteria in pet food may result in serious adverse health consequences to animals consuming the pet food and\\\\/or humans handling the pet food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they bear or contain a poisonous or deleterious substance which may render such products injurious to health.  The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated food is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(a)].  You may find the Act and FDA\\\\u2019s regulations through links on FDA\\\\u2019s homepage at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nAfter FDA notified you of the sample results, you recalled BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102 and BRB Complete, Lot # GA 0131. The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you placed BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on hold pending sample results and no portion of the lot was never distributed. \\\\n \\\\nPrior Samples\\\\n \\\\nWe note that your firm has had prior instances of contamination with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent problems with your manufacturing processes and\\\\/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received two consumer complaints regarding your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs). We collected unopened samples of your products in response to these complaints and the table below summarizes the results.\\\\n \\\\nProduct\\\\nFDA Sample Number\\\\nDate Collected\\\\nPositive Results\\\\nBRB Kitten Grind\\\\n892533\\\\n11\\\\/14\\\\/2016\\\\nSalmonella, Escherichia coli\\\\nBRB for Dogs\\\\n977933\\\\n11\\\\/21\\\\/2016\\\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\\\nBRB for Dogs\\\\n915615\\\\n11\\\\/21\\\\/2016\\\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\\\nBRB Turkey w\\\\/ Bone\\\\n959477\\\\n12\\\\/14\\\\/2016\\\\nL. monocytogenes\\\\nBRB Beef Complete\\\\n959478\\\\n12\\\\/14\\\\/2016\\\\nSalmonella, L. monocytogenes\\\\n \\\\nOn June 15, 2017, we sent you an Untitled Letter (ATL-17-U02) notifying you of the results of the 2016 samples; we note that you recalled the lots that you had distributed. The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, such products will cause serious adverse health consequences or death (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\\\n \\\\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\\\n \\\\nUnlike other pet foods which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your pet food products present particular hazards to human and animal health because they contain uncooked animal proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw pet food is produced with minimal processing and is intended to be handled by humans and fed to animals without cooking, that is, without measures routinely used to kill potentially harmful pathogens. It is therefore essential that your firm has measures in place to prevent and reduce pathogenic contamination of your products and facility. \\\\n \\\\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in both humans and animals. Pets like dogs and cats may get Salmonella infections from eating contaminated pet foods. People may also contract Salmonella infections from handling these contaminated pet foods or having contact with infected pets or their feces. Infections can be especially serious in young children, elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy individuals, as well as pets, may suffer short-term symptoms such as severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a pet food to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial heat step or other commercial process to kill the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA\\\\u2019s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/iceci\\\\/compliancemanuals\\\\/compliancepolicyguidancemanual\\\\/ucm361105.pdf\\\\n \\\\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute danger to human and animal health. It can proliferate in animal food processing facilities that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated pet foods can lead to a severe, sometimes life-threatening illness called listeriosis. Pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems, including young children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more vulnerable to these infections. Healthy individuals as well as pets may suffer short-term symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. \\\\n \\\\nAntimicrobial Treatments\\\\n \\\\nDuring the FDA inspection in March 2018, you indicated that your firm uses a (b)(4) during manufacturing to reduce the presence of pathogens in your pet foods. \\\\n \\\\nAny substance that is reasonably expected to become a component of food is a food additive that is subject to premarket approval by FDA, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety under the conditions of its intended use, meets one of the other exclusions from the food additive definition in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, or is otherwise permitted for use in animal food. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes use of (b)(4) in animal food, and the agency is unaware of any data or information to demonstrate that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the conditions of intended use (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\\\n \\\\nWe received your written response, dated March 29, 2018, following the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the use of your \\\\u201cactive kill agents\\\\u201d during manufacturing, including the use of (b)(4). However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your response lacks important specific details showing evidence of the safety of your raw pet food products. Also, your response does not address whether you have determined these \\\\u201ckill agents\\\\u201d are in fact GRAS under their intended conditions of use.\\\\n \\\\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and processing practices. Some of these changes include but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the facility from outside environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the use of sanitizing foot baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective actions will be evaluated during our next inspection of your manufacturing facility.\\\\n \\\\nConclusion\\\\n \\\\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your product(s). You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition to the above violations, we have the following comments:\\\\n \\\\nWe note that your facility is subject to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for food for animals (21 CFR part 507, subpart B), which provide baseline food safety and sanitation standards for facilities manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding animal food.  Animal food that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and held in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and sections 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please see FDA\\\\u2019s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM499200.pdf.   \\\\n \\\\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR part 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption applies (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must develop and implement a food safety plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified individual (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the preparation of, a written hazard analysis to identify known or reasonably foreseeable hazardsfor each type of animal food produced at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine if your firm has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as appropriate to your animal food and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are known and reasonably foreseeable hazards in raw meat pet food. For more information on this topic, you may refer to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM592870.pdf.\\\\n \\\\nWithin fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete the corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\\\n \\\\nYour written response should be sent to:  U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 Eighth Street, NE Atlanta, GA 30309, to the attention of Janice L.

January 24, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\\\\u201cFDA\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cwe\\\\u201d) received a [NV]complaint[E] (\\\\u201cJanuary 24 complaint\\\\u201d) from a consumer who reported the [NV]death[E] of [PV]two[E] kittens from Salmonella septicemia (confirmed by necropsy) after the kittens [PV]ate[E] your Blue Ridge Beef (BRB) Kitten Grind for Cats product. In [PV]response[E] to this complaint, on January 30, 2018, FDA investigators collected from the consumer an unopened package of BRB Kitten Grind, Lot # GA 1102, manufactured on November 2, 2017 (FDA Sample #1038721). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes. The FDA laboratory also conducted Whole Genome Sequencing[1] analysis of Sample #1038721 and diagnostic [PV]samples[E] collected during the necropsy of [PV]one[E] of the kittens that died after [PV]eating[E] your product. This analysis revealed that the Salmonellafound in the kitten\\\\u2019s spleen, kidney, and [NV]small[E] [NV]intestine[E] was identical to the Salmonella [NV]isolated[E] from BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, FDA Sample #1038721, demonstrating that your BRB Kitten Grind product was the [PV]source[E] of illness.  \\\\n \\\\nAlso, in [PV]response[E] to the January 24 complaint, FDA conducted an inspection of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]facility[E] at 106 Maddox Road, Eatonton, GA, on March 6 through 8, 2018. During our inspection, FDA collected an unopened package of BRB Complete, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on January 31, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002024). This [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes.  We also collected an unopened finished product [PV]sample[E] of BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # (b)(4), manufactured on February 8, 2018 (FDA Sample #1002025).   The [PV]sample[E] was analyzed by an FDA laboratory and was [PV]found[E] [PV]positive[E] for Salmonella.  \\\\n \\\\nThe presence of Salmonella, L. monocytogenes or other pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] in [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] may [PV]result[E] in [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] to [PV]animals[E] consuming the [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] and\\\\/or humans [PV]handling[E] the [PV]pet[E] food. Therefore, as discussed above, your Blue Ridge Beef Kitten Grind for Cats and Blue Ridge Beef Complete products are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) in that they [PV]bear[E] or [PV]contain[E] a [NV]poisonous[E] or deleterious [PV]substance[E] which may render such products injurious to health.  The [PV]introduction[E] or [PV]delivery[E] for [PV]introduction[E] into interstate commerce of an adulterated [PV]food[E] is a [NV]violation[E] of [PV]section[E] 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(a)].

The FDA designated these recalls as Class I, based onareasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41). You reported that you [PV]placed[E] BRB Kitten Grind for Cats, Lot # GA 0208, on [PV]hold[E] [NV]pending[E] [PV]sample[E] [PV]results[E] and no portion of the [PV]lot[E] was never distributed. \\\\n \\\\nPrior Samples\\\\n \\\\nWe note that your [PV]firm[E] has had prior instances of [NV]contamination[E] with L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and Escherichia coli, which indicates ongoing, persistent [NV]problems[E] with your [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]processes[E] and\\\\/or facility. Specifically, in November 2016, FDA received [PV]two[E] consumer [NV]complaints[E] [PV]regarding[E] your products (BRB Kitten Grind and BRB for Dogs).

The FDA also designated this recall as Class I, based on areasonable [PV]probability[E] that the [PV]use[E] of, or exposure to, such products will [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] [NV]adverse[E] [NV]health[E] [NV]consequences[E] or [NV]death[E] (see 21 CFR 7.3(m)(1) and 21 CFR 7.41).\\\\n \\\\nPublic Health Impact of Pathogens\\\\n \\\\nUnlike other [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] which are heat-treated or intended to be cooked, your [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products [PV]present[E] [PV]particular[E] hazards to human and [PV]animal[E] [NV]health[E] because they [PV]contain[E] uncooked [PV]animal[E] proteins in a ready-to-eat product. Raw [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] is [PV]produced[E] with minimal [PV]processing[E] and is intended to be [PV]handled[E] by humans and [PV]fed[E] to [PV]animals[E] without cooking, that is, without [PV]measures[E] routinely [NV]used[E] to [NV]kill[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] pathogens. It is therefore [PV]essential[E] that your [PV]firm[E] has [PV]measures[E] in [PV]place[E] to prevent and [NV]reduce[E] pathogenic [NV]contamination[E] of your products and facility. \\\\n \\\\nSalmonella is a pathogenic bacterium that can [PV]cause[E] [PV]serious[E] and sometimes [NV]fatal[E] infections in both humans and animals. Pets [PV]like[E] [PV]dogs[E] and [PV]cats[E] may [PV]get[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]eating[E] contaminated [PV]pet[E] foods. People may also [PV]contract[E] Salmonella infections from [PV]handling[E] these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] or having [PV]contact[E] with infected [PV]pets[E] or their feces. Infections can be especially [PV]serious[E] in [PV]young[E] children, elderly people, and others with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems. Healthy individuals, as [PV]well[E] as pets, may [NV]suffer[E] short-term symptoms such as [NV]severe[E] diarrhea, [NV]bloody[E] diarrhea, fever, chills, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. FDA considers a [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] to be adulterated when it is contaminated with Salmonella and will not undergo a commercial [PV]heat[E] [PV]step[E] or other commercial process to [NV]kill[E] the Salmonella, as expressed in FDA\\\\u2019s Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) Salmonella in Food for Animals, CPG Sec.690.800, https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/iceci\\\\/compliancemanuals\\\\/compliancepolicyguidancemanual\\\\/ucm361105.pdf\\\\n \\\\nListeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that poses an acute [PV]danger[E] to human and [PV]animal[E] health. It can proliferate in [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facilities[E] that are not properly sanitized. Handling or consuming these contaminated [PV]pet[E] [PV]foods[E] can [PV]lead[E] to a severe, sometimes life-threatening [NV]illness[E] [PV]called[E] listeriosis. Pregnant [PV]women[E] and [PV]people[E] with weakened [PV]immune[E] systems, including [PV]young[E] children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals, are more [NV]vulnerable[E] to these infections.

There is no [PV]food[E] additive regulation that authorizes [PV]use[E] of (b)(4) in [PV]animal[E] food, and the agency is [PV]unaware[E] of any data or [PV]information[E] to [NV]demonstrate[E] that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the [NV]conditions[E] of intended [PV]use[E] (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\\\n \\\\nWe received your [PV]written[E] response, dated March 29, 2018, [PV]following[E] the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the [PV]use[E] of your \\\\u201cactive [NV]kill[E] agents\\\\u201d during manufacturing, including the [PV]use[E] of (b)(4). However, we are [NV]unable[E] to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your [PV]response[E] lacks [PV]important[E] specific [PV]details[E] [PV]showing[E] evidence of the [PV]safety[E] of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products. Also, your [PV]response[E] does not address whether you have [NV]determined[E] these \\\\u201ckill agents\\\\u201d are in fact GRAS under their intended [NV]conditions[E] of use.\\\\n \\\\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and [PV]processing[E] practices. Some of these changes [PV]include[E] but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the [PV]facility[E] from [PV]outside[E] environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the [PV]use[E] of sanitizing [PV]foot[E] baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective [PV]actions[E] will be evaluated during our next inspection of your [PV]manufacturing[E] facility.\\\\n \\\\nConclusion\\\\n \\\\nThe [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this [PV]letter[E] are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of [NV]violations[E] that exist in connection with your product(s). You are [PV]responsible[E] for investigating and [PV]determining[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] [PV]identified[E] above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [PV]firm[E] complies with all requirements of [NV]federal[E] law and FDA regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the above violations, we have the [PV]following[E] comments:\\\\n \\\\nWe note that your [PV]facility[E] is [PV]subject[E] to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for [PV]food[E] for [PV]animals[E] (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B), which [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).

To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are [PV]known[E] and [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards in [NV]raw[E] [PV]meat[E] [PV]pet[E] food.

There is no [PV]food[E] additive regulation that authorizes [PV]use[E] of (b)(4) in [PV]animal[E] food, and the agency is [PV]unaware[E] of any data or [PV]information[E] to [NV]demonstrate[E] that the (b)(4) is GRAS under the [NV]conditions[E] of intended [PV]use[E] (i.e., as an antimicrobial agent). \\\\n \\\\nWe received your [PV]written[E] response, dated March 29, 2018, [PV]following[E] the FDA inspection. In that response, you stated that you have expanded the [PV]use[E] of your \\\\u201cactive [NV]kill[E] agents\\\\u201d during manufacturing, including the [PV]use[E] of (b)(4). However, we are [NV]unable[E] to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, as your [PV]response[E] lacks [PV]important[E] specific [PV]details[E] [PV]showing[E] evidence of the [PV]safety[E] of your [NV]raw[E] [PV]pet[E] [PV]food[E] products. Also, your [PV]response[E] does not address whether you have [NV]determined[E] these \\\\u201ckill agents\\\\u201d are in fact GRAS under their intended [NV]conditions[E] of use.\\\\n \\\\nWe also note that you proposed several changes to your cleaning, manufacturing, handling, and [PV]processing[E] practices. Some of these changes [PV]include[E] but are not limited to updated cleaning procedures, sealing off the [PV]facility[E] from [PV]outside[E] environmental factors, cleaning throughout various stages of processing, the [PV]use[E] of sanitizing [PV]foot[E] baths at foot-traffic entrances, and test-hold procedures for final products. These corrective [PV]actions[E] will be evaluated during our next inspection of your [PV]manufacturing[E] facility.\\\\n \\\\nConclusion\\\\n \\\\nThe [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this [PV]letter[E] are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of [NV]violations[E] that exist in connection with your product(s). You are [PV]responsible[E] for investigating and [PV]determining[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] [PV]identified[E] above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] that your [PV]firm[E] complies with all requirements of [NV]federal[E] law and FDA regulations. You should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [NV]cited[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further notice, including, without limitation, [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]addition[E] to the above violations, we have the [PV]following[E] comments:\\\\n \\\\nWe note that your [PV]facility[E] is [PV]subject[E] to Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (CGMPs) for [PV]food[E] for [PV]animals[E] (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subpart B), which [PV]provide[E] baseline [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] and sanitation [PV]standards[E] for [PV]facilities[E] manufacturing, processing, packing, and [PV]holding[E] [PV]animal[E] food.  Animal [PV]food[E] that is not manufactured, processed, packed, and [NV]held[E] in accordance with CGMPs may be considered adulterated (21 CFR 507.1(a) (1) (i-ii) and [PV]sections[E] 402(a)(3) and (4) of the FD&C Act).  Please [PV]see[E] FDA\\\\u2019s Guidance for Industry #235, Current Good Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Food for Animals, at https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM499200.pdf.   \\\\n \\\\nStarting on September 17, 2018, you must also comply with [NV]hazard[E] analysis and risk-based preventive controls requirements (21 CFR [PV]part[E] 507, subparts C and E), unless an exemption [PV]applies[E] (21 CFR 507.5).  To comply with the preventive controls requirements, you must [PV]develop[E] and implement a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] plan.  Specifically, a preventive controls qualified [PV]individual[E] (PCQI) must prepare, or oversee the [PV]preparation[E] of, a [PV]written[E] [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]identify[E] [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazardsfor each [PV]type[E] of [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]produced[E] at your facility.  The PCQI, or designee, must then evaluate the [PV]known[E] or [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards to [PV]determine[E] if your [PV]firm[E] has any hazards requiring a preventive control, and you must implement preventive controls as [PV]appropriate[E] to your [PV]animal[E] [PV]food[E] and facility.  We note that Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes are [PV]known[E] and [PV]reasonably[E] foreseeable hazards in [NV]raw[E] [PV]meat[E] [PV]pet[E] food. For more [PV]information[E] on this topic, you may [PV]refer[E] to our draft guidance: Guidance for Industry #245, Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals, at https:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/downloads\\\\/AnimalVeterinary\\\\/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement\\\\/GuidanceforIndustry\\\\/UCM592870.pdf.\\\\n \\\\nWithin fifteen [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] of receipt of this letter, [PV]please[E] notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] that you have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] violations.

inspection of your seafood processing facility, Natural Sea Product Co., Ltd., located at 29\\\\/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed serious violations of the seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA\\\\u2019s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm at the conclusion of the inspection. We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a cover letter outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP plan entitled \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d that covers your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products, and photos of corrective actions made to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your response is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\\\n \\\\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), failure of a seafood processing facility to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with this section or otherwise operate in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the fish or fishery products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried fish products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, the seafood HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through links on FDA\\'s home page at www.fda.gov. The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations regarding identification and control of food safety hazards reasonably likely to occur for your fish and fishery products, can be found on our web site at: http:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/food\\\\/guidanceregulation\\\\/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation\\\\/seafood\\\\/ucm2018426.htm\\\\n \\\\nWe found the following significant deviations:  \\\\n \\\\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a hazard analysis for each kind of fish and fishery product that you produce to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A food safety hazard is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \\'any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email entitled \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d does not list the food safety hazard of natural toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is reasonably likely to occur in yellow stripe trevally caught in tropical and subtropical waters that your firm needs to control as the primary processor receiving the fish directly from the harvest vessels.  \\\\n \\\\n2.    You must conduct a hazard analysis to determine whether there are food safety hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A critical control point (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \\'point, step, or procedure in a food process at which control can be applied and a food safety hazard can as a result be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP plan entitled \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d does not list the following CCPs that are necessary to control each of the identified food safety hazards. Specifically,\\\\n \\\\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the food safety hazard of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is reasonably likely to occur in your dried scombroid species fish while held (b)(4). FDA recommends you include a refrigerated storage CCP to ensure that products held for extended time periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4\\\\u00b0 C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by ice throughout the storage period.\\\\n \\\\nb.  A (b)(4) critical control point to control the food safety hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic bacteria growth and toxin formation. FDA recommends you include salting and curing CCPs to ensure that the fish are held at appropriate temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and toxin formation (i.e., including the potential for growth and toxin formation from the salt tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism identified in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the fish are continuously held at 4.4\\\\u00b0 C or below for the entire duration of the salting\\\\/curing step.\\\\n \\\\n3.    You must have a HACCP plan that, at a minimum, lists the critical limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A critical limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \\'the maximum or minimum value to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to prevent, eliminate, or reduce to an acceptable level the occurrence of the identified food safety hazard.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP plan provided with your May 22, 2018, email for \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d lists critical limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and toxin formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d critical control point your critical limit of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d alone is not adequate to control the identified food safety hazards.  FDA recommends that you also include corresponding critical limits for time or temperature or a combination of both at this step to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a safe water activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the fish flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d CCP list processing temperatures of (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4)\\\\u00b0C. Although (b)(4)\\\\u00b0C is sufficient to control S. aureusgrowth\\\\/toxin formation, it is inadequate to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60\\\\u00b0C or higher to inhibit\\\\/prevent histamine formation during extended drying\\\\/dehydration time periods when there is no critical limit for time. At your current processing temperatures of (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4) \\\\u00b0C, FDA recommends that you establish through a scientific study, the processing parameters that will allow the fish flesh to achieve a water activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures currently listed in your monitoring procedures should be listed as critical limits if they are critical drying factors.  This would also apply to any critical limits for time that you establish as critical to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your firm is monitoring the moisture conditions in the solar dome. If this is a critical factor, you should consider establishing a critical limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\\\n \\\\nYou should respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific things you are doing to correct these violations. More specifically, your response should include documentation and information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) consecutive days of completed monitoring records (i.e., complete sets of monitoring records for the production of 5 production date codes of products) to demonstrate implementation of the plan, and any additional information that you wish to supply that provides assurance of your intent to fully comply now and in the future with the seafood HACCP regulation. If you cannot complete all corrections within 15 days, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you believe you have complied with FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.\\\\n \\\\nIf you do not respond or if we find your response inadequate, we may take further action. For instance, we may take further action to refuse admission of your imported fish or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 381(a)), including placing them on detention without physical examination (DWPE). FDA\\\\u2019s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products offered for import into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry. DWPE information may be conveyed in FDA\\\\u2019s Import Alerts. For your information, an example of an Import Alert that conveys information specific to foreign firms that are not in compliance with the seafood HACCP regulation is Import Alert 16-120. This alert can be found on FDA\\\\u2019s web site at: http:\\\\/\\\\/www.accessdata.fda.gov\\\\/cms_ia\\\\/importalert_25.html\\\\n \\\\nThis letter may not list all the deviations at your facility. You are responsible for ensuring that your processing plant operates in compliance with the Act and all applicable regulations, including the seafood HACCP and the current Good Manufacturing Practice Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117 Subpart B).  You also have a responsibility to use procedures to prevent further violations of the Act and all applicable regulations.\\\\n \\\\nAdditionally, Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA\\\\u2019s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a foreign facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the foreign facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs. Please consider providing a copy of this letter to your U.S. Agent.\\\\n \\\\nPlease send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Marco Esteves, Compliance Officer, Office of Compliance, Division of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740 U.S.A.

29\\\\/6, Moo 3; Tambol Bangyapak, Muang Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, Samut Sakhon, 74000, Thailand on May 8 and 9, 2018.  That inspection revealed [PV]serious[E] [NV]violations[E] of the [PV]seafood[E] Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA\\\\u2019s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, [PV]listing[E] the deviations [PV]found[E] at your [PV]firm[E] at the conclusion of the inspection. We [PV]acknowledge[E] receipt of your [PV]response[E] received via email on May 22, 2018, which included a [PV]cover[E] [PV]letter[E] outlining your corrective actions, a revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d that [PV]covers[E] your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried [PV]fish[E] products, and photos of corrective [PV]actions[E] [PV]made[E] to the facility. Review of the documentation revealed that your [PV]response[E] is not adequate, as further described in this letter. \\\\n \\\\nIn accordance with 21 CFR 123.6(g), [NV]failure[E] of a [PV]seafood[E] [PV]processing[E] [PV]facility[E] to have and implement a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that complies with this [PV]section[E] or otherwise [NV]operate[E] in accordance with the requirements of Part 123 renders the [PV]fish[E] or fishery products adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4). Accordingly, your shelf-stable, vacuum-packaged dried [PV]fish[E] products are adulterated, in that they have been prepared, packed, or [PV]held[E] under [NV]conditions[E] whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may [PV]find[E] the Act, the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation and the 4th Edition of the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guidance (the Hazards Guide) through [PV]links[E] on FDA\\'s [PV]home[E] [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov.

You must conduct or have conducted a [NV]hazard[E] analysis for each [PV]kind[E] of [PV]fish[E] and fishery product that you [PV]produce[E] to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \\'any biological, chemical, or physical property that may [PV]cause[E] a [PV]food[E] to be [NV]unsafe[E] for human consumption.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email [PV]entitled[E] \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of [NV]natural[E] toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in [PV]yellow[E] stripe trevally [NV]caught[E] in [PV]tropical[E] and subtropical [PV]waters[E] that your [PV]firm[E] needs to control as the [PV]primary[E] processor receiving the [PV]fish[E] directly from the [PV]harvest[E] vessels.  \\\\n \\\\n2.    You must conduct a [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \\'point, step, or procedure in a [PV]food[E] [PV]process[E] at which control can be [PV]applied[E] and a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] can as a [PV]result[E] be prevented, eliminated, or [NV]reduced[E] to acceptable levels.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]following[E] CCPs that are necessary to control each of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards. Specifically,\\\\n \\\\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in your dried scombroid species [PV]fish[E] while [PV]held[E] (b)(4). FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] a refrigerated [PV]storage[E] CCP to [PV]ensure[E] that products [PV]held[E] for extended [PV]time[E] periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4\\\\u00b0 C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by [PV]ice[E] throughout the [PV]storage[E] period.\\\\n \\\\nb.  A (b)(4) [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation. FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] salting and curing CCPs to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]fish[E] are [PV]held[E] at [PV]appropriate[E] temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation (i.e., including the [PV]potential[E] for growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation from the [PV]salt[E] tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism [PV]identified[E] in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the [PV]fish[E] are continuously [PV]held[E] at 4.4\\\\u00b0 C or below for the entire duration of the salting\\\\/curing step.\\\\n \\\\n3.    You must have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A [NV]critical[E] limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \\'the maximum or minimum [PV]value[E] to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to prevent, eliminate, or [NV]reduce[E] to an acceptable [PV]level[E] the occurrence of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazard.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email for \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d [PV]lists[E] [NV]critical[E] limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] your [NV]critical[E] limit of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d [NV]alone[E] is not adequate to control the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards.  FDA recommends that you also [PV]include[E] corresponding [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] or temperature or a combination of both at this [PV]step[E] to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a [PV]safe[E] [PV]water[E] activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the [PV]fish[E] flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d CCP [PV]list[E] [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4)\\\\u00b0C. Although (b)(4)\\\\u00b0C is [PV]sufficient[E] to control S. aureusgrowth\\\\/toxin formation, it is [NV]inadequate[E] to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60\\\\u00b0C or higher to inhibit\\\\/prevent histamine formation during extended drying\\\\/dehydration [PV]time[E] periods when there is no [NV]critical[E] limit for time. At your current [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4) \\\\u00b0C, FDA recommends that you [PV]establish[E] through a scientific study, the [PV]processing[E] parameters that will [PV]allow[E] the [PV]fish[E] [NV]flesh[E] to achieve a [PV]water[E] activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures [PV]currently[E] [PV]listed[E] in your monitoring procedures should be [PV]listed[E] as [NV]critical[E] limits if they are [NV]critical[E] drying factors.  This would also [PV]apply[E] to any [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] that you [PV]establish[E] as [NV]critical[E] to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your [PV]firm[E] is monitoring the moisture [NV]conditions[E] in the solar dome. If this is a [NV]critical[E] factor, you should [PV]consider[E] [PV]establishing[E] a [NV]critical[E] limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\\\n \\\\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific things you are doing to [PV]correct[E] these violations. More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation and [PV]information[E] that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) [PV]consecutive[E] [PV]days[E] of completed monitoring [PV]records[E] (i.e., [PV]complete[E] [PV]sets[E] of monitoring [PV]records[E] for the [PV]production[E] of 5 [PV]production[E] [PV]date[E] codes of products) to [PV]demonstrate[E] [PV]implementation[E] of the plan, and any [PV]additional[E] [PV]information[E] that you [PV]wish[E] to supply that provides assurance of your [PV]intent[E] to fully comply now and in the [PV]future[E] with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation. If you cannot [PV]complete[E] all corrections within 15 days, you should [PV]explain[E] the [PV]reason[E] for your [NV]delay[E] and state when you will [PV]correct[E] any [PV]remaining[E] violations. If you [PV]believe[E] you have complied with FDA regulations, [PV]include[E] your [PV]reasoning[E] and any [PV]supporting[E] [PV]information[E] for our consideration.\\\\n \\\\nIf you do not [PV]respond[E] or if we [PV]find[E] your [PV]response[E] inadequate, we may [PV]take[E] further action. For instance, we may [PV]take[E] further [PV]action[E] to [NV]refuse[E] admission of your imported [PV]fish[E] or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 381(a)), including [PV]placing[E] them on [NV]detention[E] without physical examination (DWPE). FDA\\\\u2019s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products [PV]offered[E] for [PV]import[E] into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry.

A re-inspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a [PV]foreign[E] facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the U.S. Agent for the [PV]foreign[E] facility. The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act.

That inspection revealed [PV]serious[E] [NV]violations[E] of the [PV]seafood[E] Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 123 (21 CFR 123). That inspection resulted in FDA\\\\u2019s issuance of an FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, [PV]listing[E] the deviations [PV]found[E] at your [PV]firm[E] at the conclusion of the inspection.

The Hazards Guide, which provides our recommendations [PV]regarding[E] identification and control of [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] for your [PV]fish[E] and fishery products, can be [PV]found[E] on our web site at: http:\\\\/\\\\/www.fda.gov\\\\/food\\\\/guidanceregulation\\\\/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation\\\\/seafood\\\\/ucm2018426.htm\\\\n \\\\nWe [PV]found[E] the [PV]following[E] [PV]significant[E] deviations:  \\\\n \\\\n1.    You must conduct or have conducted a [NV]hazard[E] analysis for each [PV]kind[E] of [PV]fish[E] and fishery product that you [PV]produce[E] to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to occur, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(1). A [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(f) as \\'any biological, chemical, or physical property that may [PV]cause[E] a [PV]food[E] to be [NV]unsafe[E] for human consumption.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email [PV]entitled[E] \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of [NV]natural[E] toxins (e.g., ciguatera toxin), which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in [PV]yellow[E] stripe trevally [NV]caught[E] in [PV]tropical[E] and subtropical [PV]waters[E] that your [PV]firm[E] needs to control as the [PV]primary[E] processor receiving the [PV]fish[E] directly from the [PV]harvest[E] vessels.  \\\\n \\\\n2.    You must conduct a [NV]hazard[E] analysis to [PV]determine[E] whether there are [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards that are [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] and have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] control points, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(a) and (c)(2). A [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] (CCP) is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(b) as a \\'point, step, or procedure in a [PV]food[E] [PV]process[E] at which control can be [PV]applied[E] and a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] can as a [PV]result[E] be prevented, eliminated, or [NV]reduced[E] to acceptable levels.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] [PV]entitled[E] \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d does not [PV]list[E] the [PV]following[E] CCPs that are necessary to control each of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards. Specifically,\\\\n \\\\na.  A (b)(4) CCP that is necessary to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] [NV]hazard[E] of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation, which is [PV]reasonably[E] [PV]likely[E] to [PV]occur[E] in your dried scombroid species [PV]fish[E] while [PV]held[E] (b)(4). FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] a refrigerated [PV]storage[E] CCP to [PV]ensure[E] that products [PV]held[E] for extended [PV]time[E] periods in-process are stored continuously at a temperature of 4.4\\\\u00b0 C or below or completely and continuously surrounded by [PV]ice[E] throughout the [PV]storage[E] period.\\\\n \\\\nb.  A (b)(4) [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to control the [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogenic [NV]bacteria[E] growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation. FDA recommends you [PV]include[E] salting and curing CCPs to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]fish[E] are [PV]held[E] at [PV]appropriate[E] temperatures to prevent the hazards of scombrotoxin (histamine) formation and pathogen growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation (i.e., including the [PV]potential[E] for growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation from the [PV]salt[E] tolerant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) organism [PV]identified[E] in your HACCP plan). FDA recommends that the [PV]fish[E] are continuously [PV]held[E] at 4.4\\\\u00b0 C or below for the entire duration of the salting\\\\/curing step.\\\\n \\\\n3.    You must have a HACCP [PV]plan[E] that, at a minimum, [PV]lists[E] the [NV]critical[E] limits that must be met, to comply with 21 CFR 123.6(c)(3). A [NV]critical[E] limit is defined in 21 CFR 123.3(c) as \\'the maximum or minimum [PV]value[E] to which a physical, biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] to prevent, eliminate, or [NV]reduce[E] to an acceptable [PV]level[E] the occurrence of the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazard.\\' However, your firm\\\\u2019s revised HACCP [PV]plan[E] provided with your May 22, 2018, email for \\\\u201cDried Fish\\\\u201d [PV]lists[E] [NV]critical[E] limits that are not adequate to control S. aureus growth and [NV]toxin[E] formation and scombrotoxin (histamine) formation. Specifically, at the \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d [NV]critical[E] control [PV]point[E] your [NV]critical[E] limit of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d [NV]alone[E] is not adequate to control the [PV]identified[E] [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] hazards.  FDA recommends that you also [PV]include[E] corresponding [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] or temperature or a combination of both at this [PV]step[E] to prevent the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) and S. aureus until a [PV]safe[E] [PV]water[E] activity (<0.85 or below) is achieved in the [PV]fish[E] flesh.   However, we note that your monitoring procedures at this \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d CCP [PV]list[E] [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4)\\\\u00b0C. Although (b)(4)\\\\u00b0C is [PV]sufficient[E] to control S. aureusgrowth\\\\/toxin formation, it is [NV]inadequate[E] to control scombrotoxin (histamine) formation for the duration of the (b)(4)step. FDA recommends temperatures of 60\\\\u00b0C or higher to inhibit\\\\/prevent histamine formation during extended drying\\\\/dehydration [PV]time[E] periods when there is no [NV]critical[E] limit for time. At your current [PV]processing[E] temperatures of (b)(4) \\\\u2013 (b)(4) \\\\u00b0C, FDA recommends that you [PV]establish[E] through a scientific study, the [PV]processing[E] parameters that will [PV]allow[E] the [PV]fish[E] [NV]flesh[E] to achieve a [PV]water[E] activity of 0.85 or less within 3 hours. Additionally, the drying temperatures [PV]currently[E] [PV]listed[E] in your monitoring procedures should be [PV]listed[E] as [NV]critical[E] limits if they are [NV]critical[E] drying factors.  This would also [PV]apply[E] to any [NV]critical[E] limits for [PV]time[E] that you [PV]establish[E] as [NV]critical[E] to the drying. In addition, our investigation revealed that your [PV]firm[E] is monitoring the moisture [NV]conditions[E] in the solar dome. If this is a [NV]critical[E] factor, you should [PV]consider[E] [PV]establishing[E] a [NV]critical[E] limit for moisture (relative humidity). \\\\n \\\\nYou should [PV]respond[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from your receipt of this letter. Your [PV]response[E] should outline the specific things you are doing to [PV]correct[E] these violations. More specifically, your [PV]response[E] should [PV]include[E] documentation and [PV]information[E] that would assist us in evaluating your corrections, such as documentation reflecting the changes you made, such as a copy of your revised HACCP plan, five (5) [PV]consecutive[E] [PV]days[E] of completed monitoring [PV]records[E] (i.e., [PV]complete[E] [PV]sets[E] of monitoring [PV]records[E] for the [PV]production[E] of 5 [PV]production[E] [PV]date[E] codes of products) to [PV]demonstrate[E] [PV]implementation[E] of the plan, and any [PV]additional[E] [PV]information[E] that you [PV]wish[E] to supply that provides assurance of your [PV]intent[E] to fully comply now and in the [PV]future[E] with the [PV]seafood[E] HACCP regulation. If you cannot [PV]complete[E] all corrections within 15 days, you should [PV]explain[E] the [PV]reason[E] for your [NV]delay[E] and state when you will [PV]correct[E] any [PV]remaining[E] violations. If you [PV]believe[E] you have complied with FDA regulations, [PV]include[E] your [PV]reasoning[E] and any [PV]supporting[E] [PV]information[E] for our consideration.\\\\n \\\\nIf you do not [PV]respond[E] or if we [PV]find[E] your [PV]response[E] inadequate, we may [PV]take[E] further action. For instance, we may [PV]take[E] further [PV]action[E] to [NV]refuse[E] admission of your imported [PV]fish[E] or fishery products under Section 801(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 381(a)), including [PV]placing[E] them on [NV]detention[E] without physical examination (DWPE). FDA\\\\u2019s DWPE is an administrative procedure whereby products [PV]offered[E] for [PV]import[E] into the United States may be detained without physical examination upon entry.

You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA\\\\u2019s home page at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nOn October 26, 2017, the Acting Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 274d, determined that a public health emergency exists nationwide involving the opioid crisis. As described in more detail below, you market various kratom products for, among other things, the treatment or cure of opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms. However, these products have not been determined by FDA to be safe and effective for these (or any other) uses. Further, the unproven treatments could cause patients to forego or delay FDA-approved treatments for opioid addiction and withdrawal. The marketing and sale of unapproved opioid addiction treatment products is a potentially significant threat to the public health. Therefore, FDA is taking measures to protect consumers from products that, without approval by FDA, claim to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, treat or cure opioid addiction.\\\\n \\\\nUnapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs\\\\n \\\\nClaims on your website establish that the above-mentioned products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease \\\\u2014 including opiate withdrawal and addiction, and\\\\/or because they are intended to affect the structure or function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act. \\\\n \\\\nExamples of claims observed on the website where you take orders, www.kratomwholesale.us, that establish the intended use of your products include, but may not be limited to the following: \\\\n \\\\nOn the webpage titled \\\\u201cAbout Kratom\\\\u201d:\\\\n\\\\u201cKratom can render both mildly stimulating effects and mildly relaxing effects depending upon the measurement used. At smaller amounts, the effects tend to be slightly more stimulating; and at larger amounts, the effects tend to be more relaxing.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\u201cSome [kratom users] have reported an increase in focus, attentiveness, and social confidence resulting from the responsible use of kratom.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\u201cDue to the rise in opium costs and the discovery that kratom could relieve opium withdrawals, many users turned to kratom as a means to cure their addiction.\\\\u201d\\\\n\\\\u201cIt has been long reported that kratom has been used to treat a myriad of ailments including but not limited to: diarrhea, depression, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, stomach parasites, diverticulitis, anxiety, alcoholism, and opiate withdrawal.\\\\u201d\\\\nOn the webpage with the Blog dated February 3, titled \\\\u201c(b)(6) Battle with Opiate Addiction\\\\u201d:\\\\n\\\\u201cOne way to avoid the synthetic roller coaster of addiction is to opt for a natural alternative \\\\u2013 kratom. Kratom has been used for hundreds of years to promote opiate withdrawal relief in Southeast Asia and is quickly gaining popularity in the United States. With the rate of opiate use on the rise, people need as many options available to them as possible when battling addiction. Learn more about kratom and how it can be the solution to promoting an opiate free lifestyle by visiting our About Kratom page\\\\u201d\\\\nOn the webpage with the Blog dated July 17, titled \\\\u201cTragic Death of (b)(6)\\\\u201d:\\\\n\\\\u201c[I]s there a better way? Yes there is \\\\u2013 kratom. Kratom has been used for hundreds of years to help eliminate withdrawal symptoms from opiates of all kinds. Kratom has been used to treat everything from mild pain pill addiction to heroin addiction.\\\\u201d \\\\nYour kratom products are also \\\\u201cnew drugs\\\\u201d under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA. No approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), is in effect for these products. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). \\\\n \\\\nIn addition, your kratom products are misbranded under 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), because they lack adequate directions for use. Section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), identifies criteria for determining the prescription status of a product. Your above-mentioned kratom products are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), because in light of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, or the method of their use, or the collateral measures necessary to their use, they are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. \\\\n \\\\nYour above-mentioned kratom products are intended for the treatment or cure of opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms, and\\\\/or other conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). \\\\u201cAdequate directions for use\\\\u201d is defined in 21 CFR 201.5 as \\\\u201cdirections under which the layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended.\\\\u201d  Because the conditions for which your above-mentioned kratom products are intended require the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs, adequate directions cannot be written so that a layperson can use your products safely. Thus, your kratom products\\\\u2019 labeling fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses, which causes the products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).\\\\n \\\\nThe violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations.\\\\n \\\\nYou should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. \\\\n \\\\nWithin fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to correct violations.

Dolezal\\\\n \\\\nOn June 5, 2018 and June 11, 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your dairy operation, Dolezal Dairy, located at 947 - 24th Road Pender, Nebraska. This letter notifies you of violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that were revealed during our investigation of your operation. You can find the FD&C Act and its associated regulations on the Internet through links on the FDA\\\\u2019s web page at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nAdulteration of an Animal Offered for Human Consumption:\\\\nWe found that you offered for sale an animal for slaughter as food that was adulterated. Under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), a food is deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains a new animal drug that is unsafe under section 512 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 360b. Further, under section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4), a food is deemed to be adulterated if it has been held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\\\\n \\\\nSpecifically, our investigation revealed that on or about March 22, 2018, you sold a cow for slaughter as food, with a green ear tag numbered (b)(4) on the front and on the back, (b)(4) and (b)(4)(cow with ear tag (b)(4)). You sold this cow at (b)(4) on March 22, 2018, and it was subsequently slaughtered on March 23, 2018 at (b)(4). The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA\\\\/FSIS) analysis of tissue samples collected from this animal identified the presence of desfuroylceftiofur (marker residue for ceftiofur) at 8.649 parts per million (ppm) in kidney tissue. FDA has established a tolerance of 0.4 ppm for residues of desfuroylceftiofur in uncooked edible tissues of cattle as codified in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), section 556.113 (21 C.F.R. \\\\u00a7 556.113). The presence of this drug in edible tissue from this animal in this amount causes the food to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii).\\\\n \\\\nOur investigation also found that you hold animals under conditions that are so inadequate that medicated animals bearing potentially harmful drug residues are likely to enter the food supply. You lack an adequate system to ensure that animals medicated by you have been withheld from slaughter for appropriate periods of time to permit depletion of potentially hazardous residues of drugs from edible tissues. For example, you failed to maintain complete and accurate treatment records. Treatment records must include the condition being treated, dosage, route of administration, the person who administered treatment, and withdrawal times. Complete records should include this information, as well as diagnosis and indications for use.  Food from animals held under such conditions is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4).\\\\n \\\\nAdulteration of a New Animal Drug\\\\nWe also found that you adulterated the new animal drug Excede\\\\u2122 (ceftiofur crystalline free acid, ANADA 141-209). Specifically, our investigation revealed that you did not use this drug as directed by its approved labeling. Use of this drug in this manner is an extra-label use, as defined by 21 C.F.R. \\\\u00a7 530.3(a).\\\\n \\\\nThe extra label use of approved animal or human drugs in animals is allowed under the FD&C Act only if the extra-label use complies with sections 512(a)(4) and (5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7\\\\u00a7 360b(a)(4) and (5), and 21 CFR Part 530, including that the use must be by or on the lawful order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinarian\\\\/client\\\\/patient relationship. Extra-label use of this drug, if not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, may cause additional violative drug residues.\\\\n \\\\nOur investigation found you administered Excede\\\\u2122 (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) to a dairy cow with ear tag (b)(4) without following the indications for use and withdrawal time as stated in the approved labeling. You admitted to using Excede\\\\u2122 for unapproved uses including treating cow with ear tag (b)(4) with 18 mL of Excede\\\\u2122 (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) via a subcutaneously injection behind the ear for treatment of diarrhea and fever. Excede\\\\u2122 is not approved for treatment for diarrhea and fever. Also, you admitted to entering the wrong date in your calendar, which caused you to sell the cow with ear tag (b)(4) before the end of the meat withdrawal period specified in the approved labeling. Your extra-label use of Excede\\\\u2122 (ceftiofur crystalline free acid) was not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, in violation of 21 C.F.R. \\\\u00a7 530.11(a), and resulted in illegal drug residues, in violation of 21 C.F.R. \\\\u00a7 530.11(d). \\\\n \\\\nBecause your use of these drugs was not in conformance with their approved labeling and did not comply with 21 C.F.R. Part 530, you caused the drugs to be unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 360b(a), and adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(a)(5).\\\\n \\\\nProhibited Act (301h) False Guaranty\\\\nOur investigation also revealed that on or about October 13, 2011, Mark R. Dolezal, Co-Owner of Dolezal Dairy, signed a Consignor\\\\/Livestock Owner\\\\u2019s Certificate to (b)(4) that certifies that none of the livestock delivered to (b)(4) will have an illegal level of drug residues or the producer will inform the (b)(4) of any drugs the livestock have been given. On or about March 22, 2018, you delivered a cow from your farm to (b)(4) which contained violative residues of desfuroylceftiofur. Providing such a false guaranty is prohibited by section 301(h) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331(h). You should take appropriate actions to ensure that this violation does not recur.\\\\n \\\\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a producer of animals offered for use as food, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the food you distribute is in compliance with the law.\\\\n \\\\nYou should take prompt action to correct the violations described in this letter and to establish procedures to ensure that these violations do not recur. Failure to do so may result in regulatory action without further notice, such as seizure and\\\\/or injunction. \\\\n \\\\nYou should notify this office in writing of the steps you have taken to bring your firm into compliance with the law within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter. Your response should include each step that has been taken or will be taken to correct the violations and prevent their recurrence. If corrective action cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be completed. Please include copies of any available documentation demonstrating that corrections have been made.\\\\n \\\\nYour written response should be sent to: Attn: Tamara J.

Jeffery A. Dolezal\\\\nMr. Mark G. Dolezal\\\\nMr. Mark R. Dolezal\\\\n \\\\nCo-Owners\\\\nDolezal Dairy\\\\n947 - 24th Road\\\\nPender, Nebraska 68047\\\\n \\\\nDear Messrs. Dolezal\\\\n \\\\nOn June 5, 2018 and June 11, 2018, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your [PV]dairy[E] operation, Dolezal Dairy, located at 947 - 24th Road Pender, Nebraska. This [PV]letter[E] notifies you of [NV]violations[E] of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that were revealed during our investigation of your operation. You can [PV]find[E] the FD&C Act and its associated regulations on the Internet through [PV]links[E] on the FDA\\\\u2019s web [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nAdulteration of an Animal Offered for Human Consumption:\\\\nWe [PV]found[E] that you [PV]offered[E] for [PV]sale[E] an [PV]animal[E] for [NV]slaughter[E] as [PV]food[E] that was adulterated. Under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), a [PV]food[E] is deemed to be adulterated if it [PV]bears[E] or [PV]contains[E] a new [PV]animal[E] drug that is [NV]unsafe[E] under [PV]section[E] 512 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 360b. Further, under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4), a [PV]food[E] is deemed to be adulterated if it has been [PV]held[E] under insanitary [NV]conditions[E] whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\\\\n \\\\nSpecifically, our investigation revealed that on or about March 22, 2018, you [PV]sold[E] a [PV]cow[E] for [NV]slaughter[E] as food, with a [PV]green[E] ear [PV]tag[E] numbered (b)(4) on the [PV]front[E] and on the back, (b)(4) and (b)(4)(cow with ear [PV]tag[E] (b)(4)). You [PV]sold[E] this [PV]cow[E] at (b)(4) on March 22, 2018, and it was subsequently slaughtered on March 23, 2018 at (b)(4). The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA\\\\/FSIS) analysis of tissue [PV]samples[E] collected from this [PV]animal[E] [PV]identified[E] the presence of desfuroylceftiofur (marker [NV]residue[E] for ceftiofur) at 8.649 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) in kidney tissue. FDA has [PV]established[E] a [PV]tolerance[E] of 0.4 ppm for residues of desfuroylceftiofur in uncooked [PV]edible[E] tissues of [PV]cattle[E] as codified in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), [PV]section[E] 556.113 (21 C.F.R. \\\\u00a7 556.113). The presence of this drug in [PV]edible[E] tissue from this [PV]animal[E] in this amount [NV]causes[E] the [PV]food[E] to be adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii).\\\\n \\\\nOur investigation also [PV]found[E] that you [PV]hold[E] [PV]animals[E] under [NV]conditions[E] that are so [NV]inadequate[E] that medicated [PV]animals[E] [PV]bearing[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] drug residues are [PV]likely[E] to [PV]enter[E] the [PV]food[E] supply. You [NV]lack[E] an adequate system to [PV]ensure[E] that [PV]animals[E] medicated by you have been withheld from [NV]slaughter[E] for [PV]appropriate[E] periods of [PV]time[E] to permit depletion of potentially [NV]hazardous[E] residues of [NV]drugs[E] from [PV]edible[E] tissues. For example, you [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] [PV]complete[E] and [PV]accurate[E] treatment records. Treatment [PV]records[E] must [PV]include[E] the [NV]condition[E] being treated, dosage, route of administration, the [PV]person[E] who administered treatment, and [NV]withdrawal[E] times. Complete [PV]records[E] should [PV]include[E] this information, as [PV]well[E] as diagnosis and indications for use.

Under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(2)(C)(ii), a [PV]food[E] is deemed to be adulterated if it [PV]bears[E] or [PV]contains[E] a new [PV]animal[E] drug that is [NV]unsafe[E] under [PV]section[E] 512 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 360b. Further, under [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4), a [PV]food[E] is deemed to be adulterated if it has been [PV]held[E] under insanitary [NV]conditions[E] whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.\\\\n \\\\nSpecifically, our investigation revealed that on or about March 22, 2018, you [PV]sold[E] a [PV]cow[E] for [NV]slaughter[E] as food, with a [PV]green[E] ear [PV]tag[E] numbered (b)(4) on the [PV]front[E] and on the back, (b)(4) and (b)(4)(cow with ear [PV]tag[E] (b)(4)). You [PV]sold[E] this [PV]cow[E] at (b)(4) on March 22, 2018, and it was subsequently slaughtered on March 23, 2018 at (b)(4). The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA\\\\/FSIS) analysis of tissue [PV]samples[E] collected from this [PV]animal[E] [PV]identified[E] the presence of desfuroylceftiofur (marker [NV]residue[E] for ceftiofur) at 8.649 [PV]parts[E] per [PV]million[E] (ppm) in kidney tissue.

Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\\\n \\\\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. You may find the Act and FDA\\\\u2019s regulations through links in FDA\\\\u2019s home page at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nWe received your firm\\\\u2019s responses dated June 6 and July 13, 2018, concerning our investigators\\\\u2019 observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), Inspectional Observations, issued to your firm on May 15, 2018. We address these responses below in relation to violations observed during the inspection, which include:\\\\n \\\\n1.    Failure to validate a process whose results cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test according to established procedures, which is required by 21 CFR 820.75(a). Specifically, (b)(4) processes (b)(4)were not validated on Blackwell implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs). These (b)(4) processes (b)(4) in ICDs that failed due to high voltage arcing. This led to your firm\\\\u2019s recall Z-0582\\\\/9-2018.\\\\n \\\\nWe reviewed your firm\\\\u2019s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process steps (b)(4), (b) update supplemental material for process validation to clarify that each (b)(4) must be assessed and challenged during process validation, (c) update the change control process to incorporate instructions on how to assess risk or unintended consequence of (b)(4), (d) assess (b)(4) processes for ICDs to determine if they were properly validated and have adequate process controls, and (e) perform an assessment of process validations for Blackwell ICDs non-fully verifiable processes to evaluate if applicable product specifications were challenged per process validation and design transfer requirements. Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm\\\\u2019s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance.\\\\n \\\\n2.   Failure to document (b)(4) activities in the device history record (DHR) as required by 21 CFR 820.90(b)(2). Specifically, (b)(4) on implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) was not documented in device history records.\\\\n \\\\nWe reviewed your firm\\\\u2019s responses to the FDA 483 and acknowledge your commitment to: (a) (b)(4) process, (b) update product identification and traceability procedures to clarity that (b)(4) must be documented, (c) update your training of new hires and manufacturing personnel, (d) assess manufacturing areas to identify whether similar conduct is occurring elsewhere, and (e) establish more robust equipment and\\\\/or procedure controls on ICD equipment used in manufacturing to help prevent the occurrence of undocumented (b)(4). Your responses appear to be adequate; however, some of your firm\\\\u2019s actions are still in progress, and a follow-up inspection by FDA will be necessary to verify compliance.\\\\n \\\\nYour firm should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties.  Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected.  Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected.\\\\n \\\\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again.  Include documentation of the corrections and\\\\/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken.  If your firm\\\\u2019s planned corrections and\\\\/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities.  If corrections and\\\\/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen (15) business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm\\\\u2019s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.\\\\n \\\\nAdditionally, our investigators cited observations on the FDA 483 in the areas of corrective and preventive action (21 CFR 820.100), acceptance activities (21 CFR 820.80), statistical techniques (21 CFR 820.250), and inspection, measuring, and test equipment (21 CFR 820.72).  Your firm\\\\u2019s responses appear to adequately address these observations. Implementation and effectiveness of your corrective actions will be evaluated during a follow-up inspection.\\\\n \\\\nIf you have questions regarding this letter, please contact Timothy G. Philips, Compliance Officer, by telephone at 612-758-7133, or by e-mail at Timothy.Philips@fda.hhs.gov.

Company (MPROC), located at Ceiba Norte Industrial Park, 50 Road 31, Km 24.4, Juncos, Puerto Rico, on April 23 through May 15, 2018, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [PV]determined[E] that Medtronic MPROC Juncos manufactures implantable pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, [NV]cardiac[E] resynchronization devices, and other related products. Under [PV]section[E] 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for [PV]use[E] in the diagnosis of [NV]disease[E] or other [NV]conditions[E] or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, or to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body.\\\\n \\\\nThis inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(h), in that the [PV]methods[E] [NV]used[E] in, or the [PV]facilities[E] or controls [NV]used[E] for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current [NV]good[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] practice requirements of the Quality System regulation [NV]found[E] at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA\\\\u2019s regulations through [PV]links[E] in FDA\\\\u2019s [PV]home[E] [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nWe received your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]responses[E] dated June 6 and July 13, 2018, [NV]concerning[E] our investigators\\\\u2019 [PV]observations[E] [PV]noted[E] on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), Inspectional Observations, [NV]issued[E] to your [PV]firm[E] on May 15, 2018. We [PV]address[E] these [PV]responses[E] below in [PV]relation[E] to [NV]violations[E] [PV]observed[E] during the inspection, which include:\\\\n \\\\n1.    Failure to [PV]validate[E] a [PV]process[E] whose [PV]results[E] cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test according to [PV]established[E] procedures, which is required by 21 CFR 820.75(a).

During the inspection, FDA investigators determined that your firm is a medical device manufacturer of orthopedic implants.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.\\\\n \\\\nThis inspection revealed that your devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\\\\n \\\\nWe acknowledge that during a Regulatory Meeting on April 27, 2017, Zimmer Biomet discussed \\\\u201c(b)(4),\\\\u201d a remediation project to address FDA\\\\u2019s 2016 inspectional findings. We are also aware that your firm implemented numerous interim controls as immediate containment and mitigation actions, including increased process monitoring of validated processes while remediation activities were in progress. However, our recent inspection revealed continuing, significant violations of the quality system regulations.\\\\n \\\\nWe received a response dated May 15, 2018 from Jeff Gensler, Vice President, Quality Assurance and Quality Control, which responded to the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations issued to your firm on April 24, 2018. We are also in receipt of your July 31, 2018 status update. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following:\\\\n \\\\n1.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for verifying or validating the corrective and preventive action, to ensure that such action is effective and does not adversely affect the finished device, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4). During the inspection, review of three separate CAPA\\\\u2019s revealed that your firm has not been able to demonstrate that the corrective or preventive actions taken by your firm are effective in ensuring that devices being distributed meet all finished product specifications.\\\\nCAPA CA-03092, was opened on December 1, 2016 to address inadequate process validations and process control procedures for in-process and final cleaning operations that were revealed during the previous inspection. During the inspection, we observed that you are monitoring your interim cleaning processes by requiring testing for (b)(4) (i.e., cleanliness tests). Your CAPA review board is responsible for monitoring this data to ensure it is meeting your pre-established specifications. However, during the inspection we observed an instance where your own data did not demonstrate that your cleaning process was capable of meeting the established cleanliness specification for (b)(4) group devices. For example, process performance indicators (Ppk\\\\u2019s) for (b)(4) were (b)(4) and (b)(4) from 1\\\\/28\\\\/2018 to 3\\\\/30\\\\/2018 and 12\\\\/16\\\\/2017 to 3\\\\/20\\\\/2018, respectively, which was well below your specification of (b)(4) as required in INST 28.0.0.1 (b)(4).\\\\nWe are concerned about your firm\\\\u2019s ability to verify the effectiveness of the corrective actions included in this CAPA, when errors are not being identified in your interim processes.\\\\n \\\\nIn response to this Warning Letter, you should address specific steps you are taking to address the products that may require additional remediation. You should also address how you plan to oversee your CAPA program to ensure that you are confident that all corrective actions taken by your firm are verified to be effective.\\\\n \\\\n2.    Failure to adequately ensure that when the results of a process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test that the process shall be validated with a high degree of assurance and approved according to established procedure, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a).\\\\nYour firm has not established that the (b)(4) of a (b)(4) constitutes a greater challenge to (b)(4) than the (b)(4) or (b)(4). Specifically, in your firm\\\\u2019s Zimmer Biomet \\\\u201cSUMMARY REPORT\\\\u201d of April 18, 2018, states on page (b)(4)section 8.4.2.2.2, that: \\\\n(b)(4)\\\\n \\\\nHowever, it is unclear if establishing (b)(4), alone, conveys equivalent process lethality. (b)(4) may be established during the conditioning and exposure phases, however effective (b)(4) occurs only during the exposure phase. It remains unclear whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) were adequately evaluated for process lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4). This is especially of concern since the (b)(4) are described as solid in construction; typically meaning (b)(4).\\\\n \\\\nWe are concerned about your firm\\\\u2019s ability to evaluate whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) for process lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4) because it is unclear if excluding these (b)(4) from testing is justified.\\\\n \\\\nIn response to this Warning Letter, you should address the specific steps your firm is taking for products that are currently in distribution and may require additional remediation. You should also address how you plan to oversee your sterilization validation program to ensure that you are confident that all corrective actions taken by your firm are verified to be effective.\\\\nIn regards to Sterilization Cycle (b)(4), it is unclear if the (b)(4) of (b)(4) might additionally impede (b)(4) in the (b)(4). Specifically, in the protocol for Cycle (b)(4), \\\\u201cLOADING CONFIGURATION\\\\u201d Section 2, states: \\\\u201c(b)(4).\\\\u201d This portrays a load configuration consisting of (b)(4); all consisting of (b)(4). This indicates (b)(4) with (b)(4), with the mass of (b)(4). Product in the (b)(4) may present this as an additional (b)(4) challenge.\\\\nWe are concerned about your firm\\\\u2019s ability to perform microbiological challenge testing. It is unclear which location(s), within (b)(4), and among (b)(4), constitutes the worst-case challenge in the load configuration for sterilization.\\\\n \\\\nIn response to this Warning Letter, you should address the specific steps your firm is taking for products that are currently in distribution and may require additional remediation. You should also address how you plan to oversee your sterilization validation program to ensure that you are confident that all corrective actions taken by your firm are verified to be effective.\\\\n \\\\n3.    Failure to develop, conduct, control and monitor production processes to ensure that a device confirms to its specifications, including the monitoring and control of process parameters and device characteristics during production, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(a)(2). During the inspection. we observed five separate operations in which employees on the production line were not following production procedures adequately. For example:\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) manual cleaning area was observed to be cleaning (b)(4), with a nylon brush. This individual indicated they were on step (b)(4) of the cleaning procedure, WCLN017 - Work Instruction Clean \\\\u2013 (b)(4). The employee had already  (b)(4) and was using a nylon brush to remove debris from the devices. The work instruction indicated that the (b)(4) and a wire brush was to be used to remove debris. A wire brush was not observed at the work station. The employee stated they use a nylon brush, instead of a wire brush, as the wire brush can scratch the polished surfaces. (the polished surface was previously covered with the (b)(4).)\\\\nOn April 17, 2018, an employee was observed measuring part (b)(4), for specification (b)(4) as part of their line clearance activities. According to drawing, (b)(4), specification (b)(4) upper limit should measure (b)(4) with a tolerance (b)(4). The employee measured this specification (b)(4) for the first part as (b)(4) and the second part as (b)(4) and stated the part was \\\\u201cgood.\\\\u201d These measurements were not identified as non-conformances until the operator was directly asked what the specification was and if the parts were conforming.\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) packaging area was observed packing finished (b)(4). They were using a (b)(4)\\\\u201d gauge to measure the tray seal in the metal packaging area. Your firm\\\\u2019s Package Requirements - I00051.3 states that the narrowest seal width for Seal Width-Trays is \\\\u201cnot less than (b)(4)\\\\u201d.\\\\u201d Your employee stated that the only gauge at her station was the (b)(4)\\\\u201d gauge.\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, a sterile sealing process was observed. An employee was performing sealing operations using a (b)(4) sealer. The employee was not able to demonstrate how to measure seal width using a gauge as required your Package Requirements - I00051.3. The operator incorrectly measured an area outside of the blister package seal.\\\\nOn April 11, 2018, we observed the sterile packaging operation using Sealer (b)(4). This sealer was identified as a legacy sealer whose process validation was found to be inadequate. Your firm has been relying on appropriate process monitoring to justify the continued use of this sealer. Heat Sealing Parameter Sheet (HSPS) for (b)(4) Sealer provides instructions for taking a total of (b)(4) samples for process monitoring testing and SOP 28.0.3 Sterile Packaging Sealer Monitoring step (b)(4), indicates samples should be submitted in order to demonstrate test results are obtained over the time the sterile packaging equipment was in operation. However, during the inspection, Your Quality Technician stated he performs seal integrity testing only on samples from the (b)(4) and seal strength testing only on samples taken at the (b)(4). \\\\nThe above examples were discussed during the inspection as a failure of establishing sufficient training procedures, so your response does not address the above violation. We are aware that, by (b)(4). However, this time frame is inadequate. In response to this Warning Letter, you should provide a detailed description of how you are ensuring that all employees are currently performing routine manufacturing operations in accordance with required procedures and in accordance with 21 CFR 820.70.\\\\n \\\\n4.    Failure to establish and maintain design validation procedures to ensure proper risk analysis is completed, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g). For example:\\\\nDuring the inspection, we reviewed a Process Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) #PF0700, dated November 2, 2017, as part of the design history file for your comprehensive shoulder implant, (product: XL\\\\u2010115363). This review confirmed inconsistencies in the assignment of potential severity ratings for hazards identified during design review. For example, the failure effect of \\\\u201cCompromise of the product Sterility\\\\u201d is given severity of scores of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d (necessitates minor medical intervention) or \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d (results in permanent impairment of body function or damage to body structure\\\\/ necessitates surgical intervention) for different potential failure modes. This failure effect regarding sterility was assigned a level of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d for (b)(4) line items and a level of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d in (b)(4) line items in this PFMECA. Using a severity level of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d for the failure effect of product sterility for all failure modes would result in (b)(4) of the hazard lines exceeding the acceptable level of (b)(4) which would require further mitigation by your firm. \\\\nYour response is not adequate to address the above violation. Your response indicates that you are aware of historical inconsistencies in the assignment of severity scores for failure modes at Zimmer Biomet. We are aware that you opened CAPA 02719 in July 2016 to remediate all Zimmer\\\\u2019s design history files as part of your (b)(4). We acknowledge you opened CAPA CA04257 on February 7, 2018 to update risk management files and that this CAPA includes a plan to remediate and revise all existing pFMECAS\\\\u2019s under (b)(4) by (b)(4). In previous correspondence (March 29, 2018), you have also indicated that all design history files (DHFs) for implants and instruments will be evaluated and either remediated to current design control standards or rationalized and obsoleted by the (b)(4). However, to date, no DHF\\\\u2019s have undergone complete remediation. (See CAPA 02179 Timeline)\\\\n \\\\nWe are concerned that recent design reviews conducted by your firm under (b)(4) continue to demonstrate inconsistencies. As discussed in FDA-483 item 1.C, we also observed that you have not taken a plenary \\\\u201crisk based\\\\u201d approach when performing device performance reviews as part of design reviews. In response to this Warning Letter, you should provide your plan to ensure that the design history work currently being performed by (b)(4) has been consistent and is capable of providing the required assurance that design history reviews are compliant moving forward.\\\\n \\\\n5.    Where environmental conditions could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on product quality, failure to establish and maintain procedures to adequately control these environmental conditions, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(c). For example:\\\\nDuring our inspection, we observed that at least forty non-conformance reports (NCR\\\\u2019s) have been initiated for microbial environmental action-limit excursions in controlled areas since March 17, 2017. Twenty-two of these NCR\\'s did not include an investigation into the cause of the excursion when action levels were exceeded. For example, NCR 12185873 dated October 20, 2017 noted a microbial surface plate exceeded the action limit. The NCR did not include any investigation as to a potential cause, including further identification of the organism. Your SOP 9.5.15 - Environmental Monitoring of Environmentally Controlled Areas, requires that an investigation be conducted immediately when action levels are exceeded.\\\\nAlso, on April 9, 2018, we observed the inspection of shoulder cup implants (item number TI- 115310, under an ISO Class 8 hood at the end of the (b)(4). We observed that racks and carriers (mailboxes) used to transport work order documentation for the (b)(4) process are not sanitized, even though they are routinely sent back to the hood from the uncontrolled environment through a pass-through. SOP 9.5.17 - Environmentally Controlled Areas: Cleanroom and Work Environment Practices, requires that all equipment be sanitized prior to placing it into the environmentally controlled hood. Firm personnel indicated that mailboxes were being reused indefinitely and entering the hood environment with no evidence of ever being sanitized. \\\\nYour response indicates that you have updated your procedures to ensure investigations into excursions are investigated and documented properly. You also indicated that your firm has discontinued the use of mailboxes and opened CAPA CA-04521 to address employee practices in this area. We will need to verify during a re-inspection that these actions are effective in ensuring environmental conditions are being controlled properly\\\\n \\\\n6.    Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions, including requirements for analyzing processes, work operations, concessions, quality audit reports, quality records, service records, complaints, returned product, and other sources of quality data to identify existing and potential causes of nonconforming product, or other quality problems, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(1). For example:\\\\nYour firm did not review common cause rework (CCR) data as a quality data source, during the months of January and February 2018, as required by your Work instruction #WI070002 -  NCR Quality Trending.  In addition, your other procedures - CP01602, SOP016001, and SOP070001 - do not address CCRs as a part of your quality metric review process.\\\\nWe observed that only one defect code was assigned to at least four Non-Conforming Reports (NCR) that were identified to having multiple deficiencies documented in a single record. For example, NCR12197758, NCR12226291, NCR12220917 and NCR12177720.\\\\nYour corrective action cannot be assessed at this time. Your response states that you will be revising your SOPs and work instructions to ensure that CCR data will be reviewed. We also understand that you are updating your (b)(4) system to improve your ability to trend NCRs with multiple defect codes.  In response to this Warning Letter, please provide your revised SOPs and work instructions.\\\\n \\\\nYour firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated  by  the  FDA  without  further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected.\\\\n \\\\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and\\\\/or corrective actions (which must address systemic problems) that your firm has taken. If your firm\\\\u2019s planned corrections and\\\\/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and\\\\/or corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm\\\\u2019s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter.\\\\n \\\\nWe propose a Regulatory Meeting to discuss this recent inspection. At this meeting, you should be prepared to discuss the status of your proposed corrections. Please contact our office to schedule a convenient date and time.\\\\n \\\\nIf you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Compliance Officer, Karen Archdeacon at 781-587-7491 or at karen.archdeacon@fda.hhs.gov. Please send your reply electronically to Gina Brackett, Director of Compliance Branch, at gina.brackett@fda.hhs.gov.\\\\n \\\\nFinally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm\\\\u2019s facility. It is your firm\\\\u2019s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483,  issued  at  the  close  of  the  inspection  may  be  symptomatic  of  serious  problems  in  your  firm\\\\u2019s manufacturing and quality management systems.  Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.\\\\n

Mr. Hanson:\\\\n \\\\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm\\\\u2019s medical device [NV]operations[E] at Zimmer, Biomet, Inc., 56 East Bell Drive, Warsaw, IN, from April 9 through 24, 2018. During the inspection, FDA investigators [PV]determined[E] that your [PV]firm[E] is a medical device manufacturer of orthopedic implants.  Under [PV]section[E] 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for [PV]use[E] in the diagnosis of [NV]disease[E] or other [NV]conditions[E] or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or [PV]prevention[E] of disease, or to affect the structure or any [PV]function[E] of the body.\\\\n \\\\nThis inspection revealed that your devices are adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 351(h), in that the [PV]methods[E] [NV]used[E] in, or the [PV]facilities[E] or controls [NV]used[E] for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current [PV]good[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] practice requirements of the Quality System regulation [NV]found[E] at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820.\\\\n \\\\nWe [PV]acknowledge[E] that during a Regulatory Meeting on April 27, 2017, Zimmer Biomet discussed \\\\u201c(b)(4),\\\\u201d a remediation project to [PV]address[E] FDA\\\\u2019s 2016 inspectional findings. We are also [PV]aware[E] that your [PV]firm[E] implemented numerous interim controls as [PV]immediate[E] containment and mitigation actions, including increased [PV]process[E] monitoring of validated [PV]processes[E] while remediation activities were in progress. However, our recent inspection revealed continuing, [PV]significant[E] [NV]violations[E] of the [PV]quality[E] system regulations.\\\\n \\\\nWe received a [PV]response[E] dated May 15, 2018 from Jeff Gensler, Vice President, Quality Assurance and Quality Control, which [PV]responded[E] to the Form FDA 483, List of Inspectional Observations [NV]issued[E] to your [PV]firm[E] on April 24, 2018. We are also in receipt of your July 31, 2018 status update. We [PV]address[E] your [PV]response[E] below, in [PV]relation[E] to each of the [PV]noted[E] violations. These [NV]violations[E] include, but are not limited to, the following:\\\\n \\\\n1.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures for verifying or validating the corrective and preventive action, to [PV]ensure[E] that such [PV]action[E] is [NV]effective[E] and does not adversely affect the finished device, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4). During the inspection, [PV]review[E] of three [NV]separate[E] CAPA\\\\u2019s revealed that your [PV]firm[E] has not been [NV]able[E] to [PV]demonstrate[E] that the corrective or preventive [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are [NV]effective[E] in ensuring that devices being distributed meet all finished product specifications.\\\\nCAPA CA-03092, was opened on December 1, 2016 to [PV]address[E] [NV]inadequate[E] [PV]process[E] validations and [PV]process[E] control procedures for in-process and final cleaning [NV]operations[E] that were revealed during the previous inspection. During the inspection, we [NV]observed[E] that you are monitoring your interim cleaning [PV]processes[E] by requiring testing for (b)(4) (i.e., [PV]cleanliness[E] tests). Your CAPA [PV]review[E] [NV]board[E] is [PV]responsible[E] for monitoring this data to [PV]ensure[E] it is [PV]meeting[E] your pre-established specifications. However, during the inspection we [NV]observed[E] an instance where your own data did not [PV]demonstrate[E] that your cleaning [PV]process[E] was [NV]capable[E] of [PV]meeting[E] the [PV]established[E] [PV]cleanliness[E] specification for (b)(4) group devices. For example, [PV]process[E] [PV]performance[E] indicators (Ppk\\\\u2019s) for (b)(4) were (b)(4) and (b)(4) from 1\\\\/28\\\\/2018 to 3\\\\/30\\\\/2018 and 12\\\\/16\\\\/2017 to 3\\\\/20\\\\/2018, respectively, which was [PV]well[E] below your specification of (b)(4) as required in INST 28.0.0.1 (b)(4).\\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]ability[E] to verify the [PV]effectiveness[E] of the corrective [PV]actions[E] included in this CAPA, when [NV]errors[E] are not being [PV]identified[E] in your interim processes.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] specific [PV]steps[E] you are [PV]taking[E] to [PV]address[E] the products that may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your CAPA program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\\\n \\\\n2.    Failure to adequately [PV]ensure[E] that when the [PV]results[E] of a [PV]process[E] cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test that the [PV]process[E] shall be validated with a [PV]high[E] degree of assurance and approved according to [PV]established[E] procedure, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a).\\\\nYour [PV]firm[E] has not [PV]established[E] that the (b)(4) of a (b)(4) [PV]constitutes[E] a greater challenge to (b)(4) than the (b)(4) or (b)(4). Specifically, in your firm\\\\u2019s Zimmer Biomet \\\\u201cSUMMARY REPORT\\\\u201d of April 18, 2018, states on [PV]page[E] (b)(4)section 8.4.2.2.2, that: \\\\n(b)(4)\\\\n \\\\nHowever, it is [NV]unclear[E] if [PV]establishing[E] (b)(4), alone, conveys equivalent [PV]process[E] lethality. (b)(4) may be [PV]established[E] during the conditioning and exposure phases, however [NV]effective[E] (b)(4) occurs only during the exposure phase. It [NV]remains[E] [NV]unclear[E] whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) were adequately evaluated for [PV]process[E] lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4). This is especially of [NV]concern[E] since the (b)(4) are [PV]described[E] as [PV]solid[E] in construction; typically [PV]meaning[E] (b)(4).\\\\n \\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]ability[E] to evaluate whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) for [PV]process[E] lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4) because it is [NV]unclear[E] if excluding these (b)(4) from testing is justified.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] is [PV]taking[E] for products that are [PV]currently[E] in distribution and may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your sterilization validation program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\\\nIn [PV]regards[E] to Sterilization Cycle (b)(4), it is [NV]unclear[E] if the (b)(4) of (b)(4) [PV]might[E] additionally [NV]impede[E] (b)(4) in the (b)(4). Specifically, in the protocol for Cycle (b)(4), \\\\u201cLOADING CONFIGURATION\\\\u201d Section 2, states: \\\\u201c(b)(4).\\\\u201d This portrays a [NV]load[E] configuration [PV]consisting[E] of (b)(4); all [PV]consisting[E] of (b)(4). This indicates (b)(4) with (b)(4), with the [PV]mass[E] of (b)(4). Product in the (b)(4) may [PV]present[E] this as an [PV]additional[E] (b)(4) challenge.\\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]ability[E] to [PV]perform[E] microbiological challenge testing. It is [NV]unclear[E] which location(s), within (b)(4), and among (b)(4), [PV]constitutes[E] the worst-case challenge in the [NV]load[E] configuration for sterilization.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] is [PV]taking[E] for products that are [PV]currently[E] in distribution and may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your sterilization validation program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\\\n \\\\n3.    Failure to develop, conduct, control and monitor [PV]production[E] [PV]processes[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that a device confirms to its specifications, including the monitoring and control of [PV]process[E] parameters and device characteristics during production, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(a)(2). During the inspection. we [NV]observed[E] five [NV]separate[E] [NV]operations[E] in which employees on the [PV]production[E] [NV]line[E] were not [PV]following[E] [PV]production[E] procedures adequately. For example:\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) manual cleaning [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] to be cleaning (b)(4), with a nylon brush. This [PV]individual[E] indicated they were on [PV]step[E] (b)(4) of the cleaning procedure, WCLN017 - Work Instruction Clean \\\\u2013 (b)(4). The employee had already  (b)(4) and was [PV]using[E] a nylon brush to [NV]remove[E] debris from the devices. The [PV]work[E] [PV]instruction[E] indicated that the (b)(4) and a wire brush was to be [NV]used[E] to [NV]remove[E] debris. A wire brush was not [NV]observed[E] at the [PV]work[E] station. The employee stated they [PV]use[E] a nylon brush, instead of a wire brush, as the wire brush can [NV]scratch[E] the polished surfaces. (the polished surface was previously [PV]covered[E] with the (b)(4).)\\\\nOn April 17, 2018, an employee was [NV]observed[E] measuring [PV]part[E] (b)(4), for specification (b)(4) as [PV]part[E] of their [NV]line[E] [PV]clearance[E] activities. According to drawing, (b)(4), specification (b)(4) upper limit should [PV]measure[E] (b)(4) with a [PV]tolerance[E] (b)(4). The employee measured this specification (b)(4) for the [PV]first[E] [PV]part[E] as (b)(4) and the [PV]second[E] [PV]part[E] as (b)(4) and stated the [PV]part[E] was \\\\u201cgood.\\\\u201d These measurements were not [PV]identified[E] as non-conformances until the operator was directly asked what the specification was and if the parts were conforming.\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) packaging [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] packing finished (b)(4). They were [PV]using[E] a (b)(4)\\\\u201d gauge to [PV]measure[E] the tray seal in the [NV]metal[E] packaging area. Your firm\\\\u2019s Package Requirements - I00051.3 states that the narrowest seal width for Seal Width-Trays is \\\\u201cnot less than (b)(4)\\\\u201d.\\\\u201d Your employee stated that the only gauge at her station was the (b)(4)\\\\u201d gauge.\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, a sterile sealing [PV]process[E] was observed. An employee was [PV]performing[E] sealing [NV]operations[E] [PV]using[E] a (b)(4) sealer. The employee was not [NV]able[E] to [PV]demonstrate[E] how to [PV]measure[E] seal width [PV]using[E] a gauge as required your Package Requirements - I00051.3. The operator [PV]incorrectly[E] measured an [PV]area[E] [PV]outside[E] of the blister package seal.\\\\nOn April 11, 2018, we [NV]observed[E] the sterile packaging [NV]operation[E] [PV]using[E] Sealer (b)(4). This sealer was [PV]identified[E] as a [PV]legacy[E] sealer whose [PV]process[E] validation was [NV]found[E] to be inadequate. Your [PV]firm[E] has been relying on [PV]appropriate[E] [PV]process[E] monitoring to [PV]justify[E] the continued [PV]use[E] of this sealer. Heat Sealing Parameter Sheet (HSPS) for (b)(4) Sealer provides [PV]instructions[E] for [PV]taking[E] a total of (b)(4) [PV]samples[E] for [PV]process[E] monitoring testing and SOP 28.0.3 Sterile Packaging Sealer Monitoring [PV]step[E] (b)(4), indicates [PV]samples[E] should be [PV]submitted[E] in order to [PV]demonstrate[E] test [PV]results[E] are obtained over the [PV]time[E] the sterile packaging equipment was in operation. However, during the inspection, Your Quality Technician stated he performs seal [PV]integrity[E] testing only on [PV]samples[E] from the (b)(4) and seal [PV]strength[E] testing only on [PV]samples[E] [NV]taken[E] at the (b)(4). \\\\nThe above [PV]examples[E] were discussed during the inspection as a [NV]failure[E] of [PV]establishing[E] [PV]sufficient[E] [PV]training[E] procedures, so your [PV]response[E] does not [PV]address[E] the above violation. We are [PV]aware[E] that, by (b)(4). However, this [PV]time[E] [PV]frame[E] is inadequate. In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]provide[E] a [PV]detailed[E] description of how you are ensuring that all employees are [PV]currently[E] [PV]performing[E] routine [PV]manufacturing[E] [NV]operations[E] in accordance with required procedures and in accordance with 21 CFR 820.70.\\\\n \\\\n4.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] [PV]design[E] validation procedures to [PV]ensure[E] proper [NV]risk[E] analysis is completed, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g). For example:\\\\nDuring the inspection, we reviewed a Process Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) #PF0700, dated November 2, 2017, as [PV]part[E] of the [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] file for your [PV]comprehensive[E] shoulder implant, (product: XL\\\\u2010115363). This [PV]review[E] confirmed inconsistencies in the assignment of [PV]potential[E] severity [PV]ratings[E] for hazards [PV]identified[E] during [PV]design[E] review. For example, the [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] of \\\\u201cCompromise of the product Sterility\\\\u201d is [PV]given[E] severity of [PV]scores[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d (necessitates [NV]minor[E] medical intervention) or \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d (results in permanent impairment of [PV]body[E] [PV]function[E] or [NV]damage[E] to [PV]body[E] structure\\\\/ necessitates [NV]surgical[E] intervention) for different [PV]potential[E] [NV]failure[E] modes. This [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] [PV]regarding[E] sterility was [PV]assigned[E] a [PV]level[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d for (b)(4) [NV]line[E] [PV]items[E] and a [PV]level[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d in (b)(4) [NV]line[E] [PV]items[E] in this PFMECA. Using a severity [PV]level[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d for the [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] of product sterility for all [NV]failure[E] [PV]modes[E] would [PV]result[E] in (b)(4) of the [NV]hazard[E] [PV]lines[E] exceeding the acceptable [PV]level[E] of (b)(4) which would require further mitigation by your firm. \\\\nYour [PV]response[E] is not adequate to [PV]address[E] the above violation. Your [PV]response[E] indicates that you are [PV]aware[E] of [PV]historical[E] inconsistencies in the assignment of severity [PV]scores[E] for [NV]failure[E] [PV]modes[E] at Zimmer Biomet. We are [PV]aware[E] that you opened CAPA 02719 in July 2016 to remediate all Zimmer\\\\u2019s [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] files as [PV]part[E] of your (b)(4). We [PV]acknowledge[E] you opened CAPA CA04257 on February 7, 2018 to update [NV]risk[E] management files and that this CAPA includes a [PV]plan[E] to remediate and revise all [PV]existing[E] pFMECAS\\\\u2019s under (b)(4) by (b)(4). In previous [PV]correspondence[E] (March 29, 2018), you have also indicated that all [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] files (DHFs) for implants and [PV]instruments[E] will be evaluated and either remediated to current [PV]design[E] control [PV]standards[E] or rationalized and obsoleted by the (b)(4). However, to date, no DHF\\\\u2019s have undergone [NV]complete[E] remediation. (See CAPA 02179 Timeline)\\\\n \\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] that recent [PV]design[E] [PV]reviews[E] conducted by your [PV]firm[E] under (b)(4) continue to [PV]demonstrate[E] inconsistencies. As discussed in FDA-483 [PV]item[E] 1.C, we also [NV]observed[E] that you have not [NV]taken[E] a plenary \\\\u201crisk based\\\\u201d approach when [PV]performing[E] device [PV]performance[E] [PV]reviews[E] as [PV]part[E] of [PV]design[E] reviews. In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]provide[E] your [PV]plan[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] [PV]work[E] [PV]currently[E] being [PV]performed[E] by (b)(4) has been [PV]consistent[E] and is [NV]capable[E] of providing the required assurance that [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] [PV]reviews[E] are compliant [PV]moving[E] forward.\\\\n \\\\n5.    Where environmental [NV]conditions[E] could [PV]reasonably[E] be expected to have an [NV]adverse[E] [PV]effect[E] on product quality, [NV]failure[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures to adequately control these environmental conditions, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(c). For example:\\\\nDuring our inspection, we [NV]observed[E] that at least forty non-conformance [PV]reports[E] (NCR\\\\u2019s) have been initiated for microbial environmental action-limit excursions in controlled [PV]areas[E] since March 17, 2017. Twenty-two of these NCR\\'s did not [PV]include[E] an investigation into the cause of the excursion when [PV]action[E] levels were exceeded. For example, NCR 12185873 dated October 20, 2017 [PV]noted[E] a microbial surface [PV]plate[E] exceeded the [PV]action[E] limit. The NCR did not [PV]include[E] any investigation as to a [PV]potential[E] cause, including further identification of the organism. Your SOP 9.5.15 - Environmental Monitoring of Environmentally Controlled Areas, requires that an investigation be conducted immediately when [PV]action[E] levels are exceeded.\\\\nAlso, on April 9, 2018, we [NV]observed[E] the inspection of shoulder cup implants (item number TI- 115310, under an ISO Class 8 hood at the [NV]end[E] of the (b)(4). We [NV]observed[E] that racks and carriers (mailboxes) [NV]used[E] to [PV]transport[E] [PV]work[E] order documentation for the (b)(4) [PV]process[E] are not sanitized, even though they are routinely sent [PV]back[E] to the hood from the uncontrolled [PV]environment[E] through a pass-through. SOP 9.5.17 - Environmentally Controlled Areas: Cleanroom and Work Environment Practices, requires that all equipment be sanitized prior to [PV]placing[E] it into the environmentally controlled hood. Firm personnel indicated that mailboxes were being reused indefinitely and entering the hood [PV]environment[E] with no evidence of ever being sanitized. \\\\nYour [PV]response[E] indicates that you have updated your procedures to [PV]ensure[E] investigations into excursions are investigated and documented properly. You also indicated that your [PV]firm[E] has discontinued the [PV]use[E] of mailboxes and opened CAPA CA-04521 to [PV]address[E] employee [PV]practices[E] in this area. We will need to verify during a re-inspection that these [PV]actions[E] are [NV]effective[E] in ensuring environmental [NV]conditions[E] are being controlled properly\\\\n \\\\n6.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions, including requirements for analyzing processes, [PV]work[E] operations, concessions, [PV]quality[E] [NV]audit[E] reports, [PV]quality[E] records, [PV]service[E] records, complaints, [PV]returned[E] product, and other [PV]sources[E] of [PV]quality[E] data to [PV]identify[E] [PV]existing[E] and [PV]potential[E] [NV]causes[E] of nonconforming product, or other [PV]quality[E] problems, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(1). For example:\\\\nYour [PV]firm[E] did not [PV]review[E] [PV]common[E] cause rework (CCR) data as a [PV]quality[E] data source, during the months of January and February 2018, as required by your Work [PV]instruction[E] #WI070002 -  NCR Quality Trending.  In addition, your other procedures - CP01602, SOP016001, and SOP070001 - do not [PV]address[E] CCRs as a [PV]part[E] of your [PV]quality[E] metric [PV]review[E] process.\\\\nWe [NV]observed[E] that only [PV]one[E] [NV]defect[E] code was [PV]assigned[E] to at least four Non-Conforming Reports (NCR) that were [PV]identified[E] to having multiple deficiencies documented in a [PV]single[E] record. For example, NCR12197758, NCR12226291, NCR12220917 and NCR12177720.\\\\nYour corrective [PV]action[E] cannot be assessed at this time. Your [PV]response[E] states that you will be revising your SOPs and [PV]work[E] [PV]instructions[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that CCR data will be reviewed. We also [PV]understand[E] that you are updating your (b)(4) system to [PV]improve[E] your [PV]ability[E] to [PV]trend[E] NCRs with multiple [NV]defect[E] codes.  In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, [PV]please[E] [PV]provide[E] your revised SOPs and [PV]work[E] instructions.\\\\n \\\\nYour [PV]firm[E] should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]addressed[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in regulatory [PV]action[E] being initiated  by  the  FDA  without  further notice. These [PV]actions[E] include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, [NV]federal[E] [NV]agencies[E] may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may [PV]take[E] this [PV]information[E] into [PV]account[E] when considering the [PV]award[E] of contracts. Additionally, premarket [PV]approval[E] applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation [NV]violations[E] are [PV]reasonably[E] related will not be approved until the [NV]violations[E] have been corrected. Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the [NV]violations[E] related to the subject devices have been corrected.\\\\n \\\\nPlease notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen business [PV]days[E] from the [PV]date[E] you [PV]receive[E] this [PV]letter[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] has [NV]taken[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [PV]noted[E] violations, as [PV]well[E] as an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and\\\\/or corrective [PV]actions[E] (which must [PV]address[E] systemic problems) that your [PV]firm[E] has taken. If your firm\\\\u2019s planned corrections and\\\\/or corrective [PV]actions[E] will [PV]occur[E] over time, [PV]please[E] [PV]include[E] a timetable for [PV]implementation[E] of those activities. If corrections and\\\\/or corrective [PV]actions[E] cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] within which these activities will be completed. Your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]response[E] should be [PV]comprehensive[E] and [PV]address[E] all [NV]violations[E] included in this Warning Letter.\\\\n \\\\nWe [PV]propose[E] a Regulatory Meeting to discuss this recent inspection. At this meeting, you should be [PV]prepared[E] to discuss the status of your proposed corrections. Please [PV]contact[E] our [PV]office[E] to schedule a [PV]convenient[E] [PV]date[E] and time.\\\\n \\\\nIf you have [PV]questions[E] [PV]regarding[E] any [NV]issues[E] in this letter, [PV]please[E] [PV]contact[E] Compliance Officer, Karen Archdeacon at 781-587-7491 or at karen.archdeacon@fda.hhs.gov.

It is your firm\\\\u2019s responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, [NV]issued[E] at  the  close  of  the  inspection  may  be  symptomatic  of [PV]serious[E] [NV]problems[E] in  your  firm\\\\u2019s [PV]manufacturing[E] and [PV]quality[E] management systems.  Your [PV]firm[E] should investigate and [PV]determine[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the violations, and [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]actions[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] and bring the products into compliance.\\\\n \\\\nSincerely,\\\\n\\\\/S\\\\/\\\\nJoseph Matrisciano, Jr.\\\\nProgram Division Director\\\\nOffice of Medical Device and Radiological Health Division\\\\n \\\\n \\\\n \\\\nCc:      \\\\nJeff Gensler\\\\nVice President QA\\\\/QC Zimmer Biomet, Inc.\\\\njeff.gensler@zimmerbiomet.com\\\\nAugust 15, 2018\\\\n\",\"avg\":[4.644,5.465,5.113],\"std\":[2.567,1.926,2.306],\"fq\":56.35,\"rad\":6.816414385,\"dup\":0,\"geo\":\"\",\"fmt\":\"Dear Mr. Hanson:\\\\n \\\\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your firm\\\\u2019s medical device [NV]operations[E] at Zimmer, Biomet, Inc., 56 East Bell Drive, Warsaw, IN, from April 9 through 24, 2018. During the inspection, FDA investigators [PV]determined[E] that your [PV]firm[E] is a medical device manufacturer of orthopedic implants.

We are also in receipt of your July 31, 2018 status update. We [PV]address[E] your [PV]response[E] below, in [PV]relation[E] to each of the [PV]noted[E] violations. These [NV]violations[E] include, but are not limited to, the following:\\\\n \\\\n1.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures for verifying or validating the corrective and preventive action, to [PV]ensure[E] that such [PV]action[E] is [NV]effective[E] and does not adversely affect the finished device, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(4). During the inspection, [PV]review[E] of three [NV]separate[E] CAPA\\\\u2019s revealed that your [PV]firm[E] has not been [NV]able[E] to [PV]demonstrate[E] that the corrective or preventive [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are [NV]effective[E] in ensuring that devices being distributed meet all finished product specifications.\\\\nCAPA CA-03092, was opened on December 1, 2016 to [PV]address[E] [NV]inadequate[E] [PV]process[E] validations and [PV]process[E] control procedures for in-process and final cleaning [NV]operations[E] that were revealed during the previous inspection. During the inspection, we [NV]observed[E] that you are monitoring your interim cleaning [PV]processes[E] by requiring testing for (b)(4) (i.e., [PV]cleanliness[E] tests). Your CAPA [PV]review[E] [NV]board[E] is [PV]responsible[E] for monitoring this data to [PV]ensure[E] it is [PV]meeting[E] your pre-established specifications. However, during the inspection we [NV]observed[E] an instance where your own data did not [PV]demonstrate[E] that your cleaning [PV]process[E] was [NV]capable[E] of [PV]meeting[E] the [PV]established[E] [PV]cleanliness[E] specification for (b)(4) group devices. For example, [PV]process[E] [PV]performance[E] indicators (Ppk\\\\u2019s) for (b)(4) were (b)(4) and (b)(4) from 1\\\\/28\\\\/2018 to 3\\\\/30\\\\/2018 and 12\\\\/16\\\\/2017 to 3\\\\/20\\\\/2018, respectively, which was [PV]well[E] below your specification of (b)(4) as required in INST 28.0.0.1 (b)(4).\\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]ability[E] to verify the [PV]effectiveness[E] of the corrective [PV]actions[E] included in this CAPA, when [NV]errors[E] are not being [PV]identified[E] in your interim processes.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] specific [PV]steps[E] you are [PV]taking[E] to [PV]address[E] the products that may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your CAPA program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\\\n \\\\n2.    Failure to adequately [PV]ensure[E] that when the [PV]results[E] of a [PV]process[E] cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test that the [PV]process[E] shall be validated with a [PV]high[E] degree of assurance and approved according to [PV]established[E] procedure, as required by 21 CFR 820.75(a).\\\\nYour [PV]firm[E] has not [PV]established[E] that the (b)(4) of a (b)(4) [PV]constitutes[E] a greater challenge to (b)(4) than the (b)(4) or (b)(4). Specifically, in your firm\\\\u2019s Zimmer Biomet \\\\u201cSUMMARY REPORT\\\\u201d of April 18, 2018, states on [PV]page[E] (b)(4)section 8.4.2.2.2, that: \\\\n(b)(4)\\\\n \\\\nHowever, it is [NV]unclear[E] if [PV]establishing[E] (b)(4), alone, conveys equivalent [PV]process[E] lethality. (b)(4) may be [PV]established[E] during the conditioning and exposure phases, however [NV]effective[E] (b)(4) occurs only during the exposure phase. It [NV]remains[E] [NV]unclear[E] whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) were adequately evaluated for [PV]process[E] lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4). This is especially of [NV]concern[E] since the (b)(4) are [PV]described[E] as [PV]solid[E] in construction; typically [PV]meaning[E] (b)(4).\\\\n \\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]ability[E] to evaluate whether or not the (b)(4) of the (b)(4) for [PV]process[E] lethality, in comparison to the (b)(4) because it is [NV]unclear[E] if excluding these (b)(4) from testing is justified.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] is [PV]taking[E] for products that are [PV]currently[E] in distribution and may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your sterilization validation program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\\\nIn [PV]regards[E] to Sterilization Cycle (b)(4), it is [NV]unclear[E] if the (b)(4) of (b)(4) [PV]might[E] additionally [NV]impede[E] (b)(4) in the (b)(4). Specifically, in the protocol for Cycle (b)(4), \\\\u201cLOADING CONFIGURATION\\\\u201d Section 2, states: \\\\u201c(b)(4).\\\\u201d This portrays a [NV]load[E] configuration [PV]consisting[E] of (b)(4); all [PV]consisting[E] of (b)(4). This indicates (b)(4) with (b)(4), with the [PV]mass[E] of (b)(4). Product in the (b)(4) may [PV]present[E] this as an [PV]additional[E] (b)(4) challenge.\\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] about your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]ability[E] to [PV]perform[E] microbiological challenge testing. It is [NV]unclear[E] which location(s), within (b)(4), and among (b)(4), [PV]constitutes[E] the worst-case challenge in the [NV]load[E] configuration for sterilization.\\\\n \\\\nIn [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]address[E] the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] is [PV]taking[E] for products that are [PV]currently[E] in distribution and may require [PV]additional[E] remediation. You should also [PV]address[E] how you [PV]plan[E] to oversee your sterilization validation program to [PV]ensure[E] that you are [PV]confident[E] that all corrective [PV]actions[E] [NV]taken[E] by your [PV]firm[E] are verified to be effective.\\\\n \\\\n3.    Failure to develop, conduct, control and monitor [PV]production[E] [PV]processes[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that a device confirms to its specifications, including the monitoring and control of [PV]process[E] parameters and device characteristics during production, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(a)(2). During the inspection. we [NV]observed[E] five [NV]separate[E] [NV]operations[E] in which employees on the [PV]production[E] [NV]line[E] were not [PV]following[E] [PV]production[E] procedures adequately. For example:\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) manual cleaning [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] to be cleaning (b)(4), with a nylon brush. This [PV]individual[E] indicated they were on [PV]step[E] (b)(4) of the cleaning procedure, WCLN017 - Work Instruction Clean \\\\u2013 (b)(4). The employee had already  (b)(4) and was [PV]using[E] a nylon brush to [NV]remove[E] debris from the devices. The [PV]work[E] [PV]instruction[E] indicated that the (b)(4) and a wire brush was to be [NV]used[E] to [NV]remove[E] debris. A wire brush was not [NV]observed[E] at the [PV]work[E] station. The employee stated they [PV]use[E] a nylon brush, instead of a wire brush, as the wire brush can [NV]scratch[E] the polished surfaces. (the polished surface was previously [PV]covered[E] with the (b)(4).)\\\\nOn April 17, 2018, an employee was [NV]observed[E] measuring [PV]part[E] (b)(4), for specification (b)(4) as [PV]part[E] of their [NV]line[E] [PV]clearance[E] activities. According to drawing, (b)(4), specification (b)(4) upper limit should [PV]measure[E] (b)(4) with a [PV]tolerance[E] (b)(4). The employee measured this specification (b)(4) for the [PV]first[E] [PV]part[E] as (b)(4) and the [PV]second[E] [PV]part[E] as (b)(4) and stated the [PV]part[E] was \\\\u201cgood.\\\\u201d These measurements were not [PV]identified[E] as non-conformances until the operator was directly asked what the specification was and if the parts were conforming.\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, an employee in the (b)(4) packaging [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] packing finished (b)(4). They were [PV]using[E] a (b)(4)\\\\u201d gauge to [PV]measure[E] the tray seal in the [NV]metal[E] packaging area. Your firm\\\\u2019s Package Requirements - I00051.3 states that the narrowest seal width for Seal Width-Trays is \\\\u201cnot less than (b)(4)\\\\u201d.\\\\u201d Your employee stated that the only gauge at her station was the (b)(4)\\\\u201d gauge.\\\\nOn April 9, 2018, a sterile sealing [PV]process[E] was observed. An employee was [PV]performing[E] sealing [NV]operations[E] [PV]using[E] a (b)(4) sealer. The employee was not [NV]able[E] to [PV]demonstrate[E] how to [PV]measure[E] seal width [PV]using[E] a gauge as required your Package Requirements - I00051.3. The operator [PV]incorrectly[E] measured an [PV]area[E] [PV]outside[E] of the blister package seal.\\\\nOn April 11, 2018, we [NV]observed[E] the sterile packaging [NV]operation[E] [PV]using[E] Sealer (b)(4). This sealer was [PV]identified[E] as a [PV]legacy[E] sealer whose [PV]process[E] validation was [NV]found[E] to be inadequate. Your [PV]firm[E] has been relying on [PV]appropriate[E] [PV]process[E] monitoring to [PV]justify[E] the continued [PV]use[E] of this sealer. Heat Sealing Parameter Sheet (HSPS) for (b)(4) Sealer provides [PV]instructions[E] for [PV]taking[E] a total of (b)(4) [PV]samples[E] for [PV]process[E] monitoring testing and SOP 28.0.3 Sterile Packaging Sealer Monitoring [PV]step[E] (b)(4), indicates [PV]samples[E] should be [PV]submitted[E] in order to [PV]demonstrate[E] test [PV]results[E] are obtained over the [PV]time[E] the sterile packaging equipment was in operation. However, during the inspection, Your Quality Technician stated he performs seal [PV]integrity[E] testing only on [PV]samples[E] from the (b)(4) and seal [PV]strength[E] testing only on [PV]samples[E] [NV]taken[E] at the (b)(4). \\\\nThe above [PV]examples[E] were discussed during the inspection as a [NV]failure[E] of [PV]establishing[E] [PV]sufficient[E] [PV]training[E] procedures, so your [PV]response[E] does not [PV]address[E] the above violation. We are [PV]aware[E] that, by (b)(4). However, this [PV]time[E] [PV]frame[E] is inadequate. In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]provide[E] a [PV]detailed[E] description of how you are ensuring that all employees are [PV]currently[E] [PV]performing[E] routine [PV]manufacturing[E] [NV]operations[E] in accordance with required procedures and in accordance with 21 CFR 820.70.\\\\n \\\\n4.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] [PV]design[E] validation procedures to [PV]ensure[E] proper [NV]risk[E] analysis is completed, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g). For example:\\\\nDuring the inspection, we reviewed a Process Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (PFMECA) #PF0700, dated November 2, 2017, as [PV]part[E] of the [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] file for your [PV]comprehensive[E] shoulder implant, (product: XL\\\\u2010115363). This [PV]review[E] confirmed inconsistencies in the assignment of [PV]potential[E] severity [PV]ratings[E] for hazards [PV]identified[E] during [PV]design[E] review. For example, the [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] of \\\\u201cCompromise of the product Sterility\\\\u201d is [PV]given[E] severity of [PV]scores[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d (necessitates [NV]minor[E] medical intervention) or \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d (results in permanent impairment of [PV]body[E] [PV]function[E] or [NV]damage[E] to [PV]body[E] structure\\\\/ necessitates [NV]surgical[E] intervention) for different [PV]potential[E] [NV]failure[E] modes. This [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] [PV]regarding[E] sterility was [PV]assigned[E] a [PV]level[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d for (b)(4) [NV]line[E] [PV]items[E] and a [PV]level[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d in (b)(4) [NV]line[E] [PV]items[E] in this PFMECA. Using a severity [PV]level[E] of \\\\u201c(b)(4)\\\\u201d for the [NV]failure[E] [PV]effect[E] of product sterility for all [NV]failure[E] [PV]modes[E] would [PV]result[E] in (b)(4) of the [NV]hazard[E] [PV]lines[E] exceeding the acceptable [PV]level[E] of (b)(4) which would require further mitigation by your firm. \\\\nYour [PV]response[E] is not adequate to [PV]address[E] the above violation. Your [PV]response[E] indicates that you are [PV]aware[E] of [PV]historical[E] inconsistencies in the assignment of severity [PV]scores[E] for [NV]failure[E] [PV]modes[E] at Zimmer Biomet. We are [PV]aware[E] that you opened CAPA 02719 in July 2016 to remediate all Zimmer\\\\u2019s [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] files as [PV]part[E] of your (b)(4). We [PV]acknowledge[E] you opened CAPA CA04257 on February 7, 2018 to update [NV]risk[E] management files and that this CAPA includes a [PV]plan[E] to remediate and revise all [PV]existing[E] pFMECAS\\\\u2019s under (b)(4) by (b)(4). In previous [PV]correspondence[E] (March 29, 2018), you have also indicated that all [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] files (DHFs) for implants and [PV]instruments[E] will be evaluated and either remediated to current [PV]design[E] control [PV]standards[E] or rationalized and obsoleted by the (b)(4). However, to date, no DHF\\\\u2019s have undergone [NV]complete[E] remediation. (See CAPA 02179 Timeline)\\\\n \\\\nWe are [NV]concerned[E] that recent [PV]design[E] [PV]reviews[E] conducted by your [PV]firm[E] under (b)(4) continue to [PV]demonstrate[E] inconsistencies. As discussed in FDA-483 [PV]item[E] 1.C, we also [NV]observed[E] that you have not [NV]taken[E] a plenary \\\\u201crisk based\\\\u201d approach when [PV]performing[E] device [PV]performance[E] [PV]reviews[E] as [PV]part[E] of [PV]design[E] reviews. In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, you should [PV]provide[E] your [PV]plan[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that the [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] [PV]work[E] [PV]currently[E] being [PV]performed[E] by (b)(4) has been [PV]consistent[E] and is [NV]capable[E] of providing the required assurance that [PV]design[E] [PV]history[E] [PV]reviews[E] are compliant [PV]moving[E] forward.\\\\n \\\\n5.    Where environmental [NV]conditions[E] could [PV]reasonably[E] be expected to have an [NV]adverse[E] [PV]effect[E] on product quality, [NV]failure[E] to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures to adequately control these environmental conditions, as required by 21 CFR 820.70(c). For example:\\\\nDuring our inspection, we [NV]observed[E] that at least forty non-conformance [PV]reports[E] (NCR\\\\u2019s) have been initiated for microbial environmental action-limit excursions in controlled [PV]areas[E] since March 17, 2017. Twenty-two of these NCR\\'s did not [PV]include[E] an investigation into the cause of the excursion when [PV]action[E] levels were exceeded. For example, NCR 12185873 dated October 20, 2017 [PV]noted[E] a microbial surface [PV]plate[E] exceeded the [PV]action[E] limit. The NCR did not [PV]include[E] any investigation as to a [PV]potential[E] cause, including further identification of the organism. Your SOP 9.5.15 - Environmental Monitoring of Environmentally Controlled Areas, requires that an investigation be conducted immediately when [PV]action[E] levels are exceeded.\\\\nAlso, on April 9, 2018, we [NV]observed[E] the inspection of shoulder cup implants (item number TI- 115310, under an ISO Class 8 hood at the [NV]end[E] of the (b)(4). We [NV]observed[E] that racks and carriers (mailboxes) [NV]used[E] to [PV]transport[E] [PV]work[E] order documentation for the (b)(4) [PV]process[E] are not sanitized, even though they are routinely sent [PV]back[E] to the hood from the uncontrolled [PV]environment[E] through a pass-through. SOP 9.5.17 - Environmentally Controlled Areas: Cleanroom and Work Environment Practices, requires that all equipment be sanitized prior to [PV]placing[E] it into the environmentally controlled hood. Firm personnel indicated that mailboxes were being reused indefinitely and entering the hood [PV]environment[E] with no evidence of ever being sanitized. \\\\nYour [PV]response[E] indicates that you have updated your procedures to [PV]ensure[E] investigations into excursions are investigated and documented properly. You also indicated that your [PV]firm[E] has discontinued the [PV]use[E] of mailboxes and opened CAPA CA-04521 to [PV]address[E] employee [PV]practices[E] in this area. We will need to verify during a re-inspection that these [PV]actions[E] are [NV]effective[E] in ensuring environmental [NV]conditions[E] are being controlled properly\\\\n \\\\n6.    Failure to [PV]establish[E] and [PV]maintain[E] procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions, including requirements for analyzing processes, [PV]work[E] operations, concessions, [PV]quality[E] [NV]audit[E] reports, [PV]quality[E] records, [PV]service[E] records, complaints, [PV]returned[E] product, and other [PV]sources[E] of [PV]quality[E] data to [PV]identify[E] [PV]existing[E] and [PV]potential[E] [NV]causes[E] of nonconforming product, or other [PV]quality[E] problems, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a)(1). For example:\\\\nYour [PV]firm[E] did not [PV]review[E] [PV]common[E] cause rework (CCR) data as a [PV]quality[E] data source, during the months of January and February 2018, as required by your Work [PV]instruction[E] #WI070002 -  NCR Quality Trending.  In addition, your other procedures - CP01602, SOP016001, and SOP070001 - do not [PV]address[E] CCRs as a [PV]part[E] of your [PV]quality[E] metric [PV]review[E] process.\\\\nWe [NV]observed[E] that only [PV]one[E] [NV]defect[E] code was [PV]assigned[E] to at least four Non-Conforming Reports (NCR) that were [PV]identified[E] to having multiple deficiencies documented in a [PV]single[E] record. For example, NCR12197758, NCR12226291, NCR12220917 and NCR12177720.\\\\nYour corrective [PV]action[E] cannot be assessed at this time. Your [PV]response[E] states that you will be revising your SOPs and [PV]work[E] [PV]instructions[E] to [PV]ensure[E] that CCR data will be reviewed. We also [PV]understand[E] that you are updating your (b)(4) system to [PV]improve[E] your [PV]ability[E] to [PV]trend[E] NCRs with multiple [NV]defect[E] codes.  In [PV]response[E] to this Warning Letter, [PV]please[E] [PV]provide[E] your revised SOPs and [PV]work[E] instructions.\\\\n \\\\nYour [PV]firm[E] should [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]action[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] [PV]addressed[E] in this letter. Failure to promptly [NV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in regulatory [PV]action[E] being initiated  by  the  FDA  without  further notice. These [PV]actions[E] include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, [NV]federal[E] [NV]agencies[E] may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may [PV]take[E] this [PV]information[E] into [PV]account[E] when considering the [PV]award[E] of contracts. Additionally, premarket [PV]approval[E] applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation [NV]violations[E] are [PV]reasonably[E] related will not be approved until the [NV]violations[E] have been corrected. Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the [NV]violations[E] related to the subject devices have been corrected.\\\\n \\\\nPlease notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen business [PV]days[E] from the [PV]date[E] you [PV]receive[E] this [PV]letter[E] of the specific [PV]steps[E] your [PV]firm[E] has [NV]taken[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [PV]noted[E] violations, as [PV]well[E] as an [PV]explanation[E] of how your [PV]firm[E] plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrections and\\\\/or corrective [PV]actions[E] (which must [PV]address[E] systemic problems) that your [PV]firm[E] has taken. If your firm\\\\u2019s planned corrections and\\\\/or corrective [PV]actions[E] will [PV]occur[E] over time, [PV]please[E] [PV]include[E] a timetable for [PV]implementation[E] of those activities. If corrections and\\\\/or corrective [PV]actions[E] cannot be completed within fifteen business days, state the [PV]reason[E] for the [NV]delay[E] and the [PV]time[E] within which these activities will be completed. Your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]response[E] should be [PV]comprehensive[E] and [PV]address[E] all [NV]violations[E] included in this Warning Letter.\\\\n \\\\nWe [PV]propose[E] a Regulatory Meeting to discuss this recent inspection. At this meeting, you should be [PV]prepared[E] to discuss the status of your proposed corrections. Please [PV]contact[E] our [PV]office[E] to schedule a [PV]convenient[E] [PV]date[E] and time.\\\\n \\\\nIf you have [PV]questions[E] [PV]regarding[E] any [NV]issues[E] in this letter, [PV]please[E] [PV]contact[E] Compliance Officer, Karen Archdeacon at 781-587-7491 or at karen.archdeacon@fda.hhs.gov.

It is your firm\\\\u2019s responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, [NV]issued[E] at  the  close  of  the  inspection  may  be  symptomatic  of [PV]serious[E] [NV]problems[E] in  your  firm\\\\u2019s [PV]manufacturing[E] and [PV]quality[E] management systems.  Your [PV]firm[E] should investigate and [PV]determine[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the violations, and [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]actions[E] to [NV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] and bring the

Administration (FDA) inspected your food manufacturing facility located at Calle Guadalupe # 62, Ponce, Puerto Rico, on May 21, 2018 through June 01, 2018. Our inspection found you have repeat violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations in manufacturing, packing, or holding human food, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 110.[1[i]] These violations cause your food product(s) to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act and FDA regulations in the CFR through links in FDA\\'s website at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nDuring our inspection of your facility, our investigator\\\\u2019s observations were noted on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on June 01, 2018.\\\\n \\\\nThe significant CGMP violations were as follows:\\\\n \\\\n1.    You failed to take effective measures to exclude pests from the processing areas and to protect against contamination of food on the premises by pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.35(c). Specifically, on 05\\\\/21\\\\/2018 and 05\\\\/22\\\\/2018 our investigator observed dead roaches\\\\u2019 parts too numerous to count in your firm\\'s warehouse floor next to ambient temperature raw materials such as sodium benzoate, dry onions, garlic granules, and oregano. You were previously cited for the same or similar violation during the 2009 and 2015 inspections.\\\\n \\\\n2.    Your firm failed to take all reasonable precautions to ensure that production procedures do not contribute to contamination from any source, as required by 21 CFR 110.80. Specifically, during the inspection our investigator observed while manufacturing various products with Lot No. 9450, such as \\'Sofrito Excelencia\\' (Condiment Mix) and \\'Ajo Puro\\' (Raw Grounded Garlic) the following:\\\\nEmployees in the manufacturing area where re-using disposable items as utensils. These were at least five (5) empty plastic bleach containers that were cut in halves and were being re-used as scoops and funnels for collecting and\\\\/or dispensing ingredients, processing water, and finished products filling step.\\\\nAir extractor screen in the production area was filthy and dusty, potentially allowing the falling of dust and dirt into in-process products and uncovered raw ingredients.\\\\nA pair of rubber gloves used for cleaning purposes were hanging right above exposed \\'Ajo Puro\\' (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished product. Repeat observation from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections. \\\\n3.    You must store raw materials in a manner that protects against contamination, as required by 21 CFR 110.80(a)(1). Specifically, on 05\\\\/21\\\\/2018 and 05\\\\/22\\\\/2018, our investigator observed:\\\\nIngredients such as dry onions, garlic, oregano, citric acid, and sodium benzoate stored in the ambient temperature area on top of soiled and dirty pallets. Additionally, the area was observed dusty, which could potentially contaminate ingredients.\\\\nIngredients such as red peppers and green peppers stored in the refrigerator area on pallets against the foam type walls. These foam type walls had missing sections and were soiled with what appears to be mold. In addition, the foam type ceiling was missing sections and soiled with what appears to be mold.\\\\nPackaging cardboard boxes were stored inside your non-functional and dirty refrigerator and it had soiled walls and damaged ceiling areas.\\\\nPreservatives ingredients such as salt, sodium benzoate, and citric acid placed in your manufacturing area were not properly labeled. In addition, these ingredients were stored in filthy containers and were kept un-covered while not in use. Repeat observation from our 2010 and 2015 inspections. \\\\n4.    You failed to properly store equipment, remove litter and waste, and cut weeds or grass within the immediate vicinity of the plant building that may constitute an attractant, breeding place, or harborage for pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.20(a)(1). Specifically, our investigator observed your firm\\'s warehouse area, where packaging plastic bowls, plastic lids, and glass jar containers were stored, was also used to store waste material, had at least forty (40) not-in-use refrigerators, one (1) not-in-use forklift, one (1) not-in-use 300 gallons\\\\u2019 stainless steel tank, and old carton boxes. In addition, our investigator observed that an approximately 100 square feet area of the ceiling panels installed in your firm\\'s warehouse were detached from the ceiling leaving openings that provide a potential breeding place for pests. Repeat observation from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections.\\\\n \\\\n5.    The procedures used for cleaning and sanitizing of utensils must provide adequate cleaning and sanitizing treatment as required by 21 CFR 110.35(d)(5). Specifically,\\\\nThe three (3)-compartment sink used to wash and sanitize glass jars re-used from returned products was not set up in the correct sequence of wash-rinse-sanitize. In addition, your firm manufacturing cleaning area does not have a three (3)-compartment sink and utensils are not properly cleaned while manufacturing is in progress.\\\\nOn 05\\\\/21\\\\/2018 and 05\\\\/22\\\\/2018, our investigator observed that plastic utensils were kept inside this single compartment sink and were being cleaned with water and soap alone. Repeat observation from our 2015 inspection. \\\\n6.    Your firm failed to provide adequate screening or other protection against pests as required by 21 CFR 110.20(b)(7).  Specifically, our investigator observed windows in processing area did not have any type of screening and doors leading to the receiving and\\\\/or dispatching of raw materials and finished products have a gap of approximately four (4) inches wide at the bottom. A second door connecting the exterior of the firm with this warehouse had a gap of approximately two (2) inches wide at the bottom. Repeat observation from our 2009 and 2015 inspections. \\\\n \\\\n7.    You failed to maintain buildings, fixtures or other physical facilities in a sanitary condition as required by 21 CFR 110.35(a). Specifically, our investigator observed that the floors in your processing area are not constructed from a material that could be easily cleaned and kept clean. Gaps in between floor tiles had accumulated dirt and black stains that appeared to be mold. In addition, walls in the processing area had sections of missing tiles and showed presence of what appeared to be mold. During the inspection, your firm was formulating \\'Sofrito\\' (Condiment Mix) and \\'Ajo\\' (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished products. (Repeat observation from our 2009, 2010, and 2015 inspections).\\\\n \\\\nWe note that you have not provided a written response to the Form FDA 483, Investigator Observations, issued to you on June 01, 2018. Please be aware that without a written response, we are unable to assess your understanding of the observations and any potential corrective actions to voluntarily comply with applicable regulations.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition, we have determined that your facility is subject to the biennial registration renewal requirement in \\\\u00a7 415(a)(3) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 350d(a)(3), which requires submission of a renewal registration during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, and our implementing regulation at 21 CFR Part 1, Subpart H. During the current inspection of your facility, you were advised of this requirement.  Failure to re-register a facility is a prohibited act under \\\\u00a7 301(dd) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331 (dd).  Our records indicate that, to date, this facility has not been re-registered with FDA.\\\\n \\\\nAs a responsible official of a facility that manufactures\\\\/processes, packs, or holds food for human or animal consumption in the United States, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the products you distribute are in compliance with the law.\\\\n \\\\nWe request you register your facility with FDA within fifteen (15) working days from receipt of this letter. Registration may be accomplished on-line at http:\\\\/\\\\/www.access.fda.gov. We strongly encourage the use of electronic registration because it will result in an automatic confirmation of registration and automatic issuance of a registration number. Alternatively, you may register the facility by mail or fax (e.g., if you do not have reasonable access to the Internet) using FDA\\\\u2019s food facility registration form, Form FDA 3537. This form may be obtained by calling the FDA Industry Systems Help Desk at 1-800-216-7331 or 301-575-0156, or by writing to the Agency at the following address:\\\\n \\\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, HFS-681\\\\n5600 Fishers Lane\\\\nRockville, MD 20857\\\\n \\\\nWhen completed, the form may be faxed to (301) 210-0247 or mailed to the address above. FDA will process registrations submitted by mail or fax and provide a facility\\\\u2019s registration number using the same method used to submit the registration to FDA.\\\\n \\\\nThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, Form FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm\\\\u2019s manufacturing systems. You should investigate and determine the causes of the violations and take prompt actions to correct the violations to bring your products into compliance. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice including seizure and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nSection 743 of the Act, [21 USC 379j-31], authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA\\\\u2019s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, [21 USC 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility.  The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.\\\\n \\\\nPlease notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days from receipt of this letter as to the specific steps you have taken to correct the stated violations, including an explanation of each step being taken to identify violations and make corrections to ensure that similar violations will not recur. In your response, you should include documentation, including copies of records, photographs or other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be implemented.\\\\n \\\\nYour reply should be directed to District Director, Food and Drug Administration, 466 Fern\\\\u00e1ndez Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Ms. Beira Montalvo, Compliance Officer, at (561) 416-1065, Ext. 1108, or via e-mail at Beira.Montalvo@fda.hhs.gov.\\\\n                                                                      \\\\nSincerely yours,\\\\n\\\\/S\\\\/ \\\\nRamon A.

Our inspection [PV]found[E] you have repeat [NV]violations[E] of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations in manufacturing, packing, or [PV]holding[E] human food, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 110.[1[i]] These [NV]violations[E] [PV]cause[E] your [PV]food[E] product(s) to be adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or [PV]held[E] under insanitary [NV]conditions[E] whereby they may have [PV]become[E] contaminated with filth, or may have been rendered injurious to health. You may [PV]find[E] the Act and FDA regulations in the CFR through [PV]links[E] in FDA\\'s [PV]website[E] at www.fda.gov.\\\\n \\\\nDuring our inspection of your facility, our investigator\\\\u2019s [PV]observations[E] were [PV]noted[E] on a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, [NV]issued[E] to you on June 01, 2018.\\\\n \\\\nThe [PV]significant[E] CGMP [NV]violations[E] were as follows:\\\\n \\\\n1.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]take[E] [PV]effective[E] [PV]measures[E] to [NV]exclude[E] pests from the [PV]processing[E] [PV]areas[E] and to protect against [NV]contamination[E] of [PV]food[E] on the premises by pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.35(c). Specifically, on 05\\\\/21\\\\/2018 and 05\\\\/22\\\\/2018 our investigator [NV]observed[E] [NV]dead[E] roaches\\\\u2019 [PV]parts[E] too numerous to count in your firm\\'s warehouse [PV]floor[E] next to [PV]ambient[E] temperature [PV]raw[E] materials such as sodium benzoate, [NV]dry[E] onions, garlic granules, and oregano. You were previously [NV]cited[E] for the same or similar [NV]violation[E] during the 2009 and 2015 inspections.\\\\n \\\\n2.    Your [PV]firm[E] [NV]failed[E] to [PV]take[E] all [PV]reasonable[E] precautions to [PV]ensure[E] that [PV]production[E] procedures do not contribute to [NV]contamination[E] from any source, as required by 21 CFR 110.80. Specifically, during the inspection our investigator [NV]observed[E] while [PV]manufacturing[E] various products with Lot No. 9450, such as \\'Sofrito Excelencia\\' (Condiment Mix) and \\'Ajo Puro\\' (Raw Grounded Garlic) the following:\\\\nEmployees in the [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]area[E] where re-using disposable [PV]items[E] as utensils. These were at least five (5) [NV]empty[E] plastic bleach containers that were [NV]cut[E] in halves and were being re-used as scoops and funnels for collecting and\\\\/or dispensing ingredients, [PV]processing[E] water, and finished products [PV]filling[E] step.\\\\nAir extractor [PV]screen[E] in the [PV]production[E] [PV]area[E] was [NV]filthy[E] and dusty, potentially [PV]allowing[E] the [NV]falling[E] of [NV]dust[E] and [NV]dirt[E] into in-process products and uncovered [PV]raw[E] ingredients.\\\\nA [PV]pair[E] of [PV]rubber[E] gloves [NV]used[E] for cleaning [PV]purposes[E] were [NV]hanging[E] [PV]right[E] above exposed \\'Ajo Puro\\' (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished product. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections. \\\\n3.    You must [PV]store[E] [PV]raw[E] materials in a [PV]manner[E] that protects against contamination, as required by 21 CFR 110.80(a)(1). Specifically, on 05\\\\/21\\\\/2018 and 05\\\\/22\\\\/2018, our investigator observed:\\\\nIngredients such as [NV]dry[E] onions, garlic, oregano, citric acid, and sodium benzoate stored in the [PV]ambient[E] temperature [PV]area[E] on [PV]top[E] of soiled and [NV]dirty[E] pallets. Additionally, the [PV]area[E] was [NV]observed[E] dusty, which could potentially [NV]contaminate[E] ingredients.\\\\nIngredients such as [PV]red[E] peppers and [PV]green[E] peppers stored in the refrigerator [PV]area[E] on pallets against the [PV]foam[E] [PV]type[E] walls. These [PV]foam[E] [PV]type[E] walls had [NV]missing[E] [PV]sections[E] and were soiled with what appears to be mold. In addition, the [PV]foam[E] [PV]type[E] ceiling was [NV]missing[E] [PV]sections[E] and soiled with what appears to be mold.\\\\nPackaging cardboard [PV]boxes[E] were stored inside your non-functional and [NV]dirty[E] refrigerator and it had soiled walls and damaged ceiling areas.\\\\nPreservatives ingredients such as salt, sodium benzoate, and citric [NV]acid[E] [PV]placed[E] in your [PV]manufacturing[E] [PV]area[E] were not properly labeled. In addition, these ingredients were stored in [NV]filthy[E] containers and were [NV]kept[E] un-covered while not in use. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2010 and 2015 inspections. \\\\n4.    You [NV]failed[E] to properly [PV]store[E] equipment, [NV]remove[E] [NV]litter[E] and waste, and [NV]cut[E] weeds or [PV]grass[E] within the [PV]immediate[E] vicinity of the [PV]plant[E] [PV]building[E] that may [PV]constitute[E] an attractant, breeding place, or harborage for pests, as required by 21 CFR 110.20(a)(1). Specifically, our investigator [NV]observed[E] your firm\\'s warehouse area, where packaging plastic bowls, plastic lids, and [NV]glass[E] jar containers were stored, was also [NV]used[E] to [PV]store[E] [NV]waste[E] material, had at least forty (40) not-in-use refrigerators, [PV]one[E] (1) not-in-use forklift, [PV]one[E] (1) not-in-use 300 gallons\\\\u2019 stainless steel tank, and [NV]old[E] carton boxes. In addition, our investigator [NV]observed[E] that an approximately 100 [NV]square[E] [PV]feet[E] [PV]area[E] of the ceiling panels installed in your firm\\'s warehouse were [NV]detached[E] from the ceiling leaving openings that [PV]provide[E] a [PV]potential[E] breeding [PV]place[E] for pests. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009, 2012, and 2015 inspections.\\\\n \\\\n5.    The procedures [NV]used[E] for cleaning and sanitizing of utensils must [PV]provide[E] adequate cleaning and sanitizing treatment as required by 21 CFR 110.35(d)(5). Specifically,\\\\nThe three (3)-compartment sink [NV]used[E] to wash and sanitize [NV]glass[E] jars re-used from [PV]returned[E] products was not set up in the [PV]correct[E] sequence of wash-rinse-sanitize. In addition, your [PV]firm[E] [PV]manufacturing[E] cleaning [PV]area[E] does not have a three (3)-compartment sink and utensils are not properly cleaned while [PV]manufacturing[E] is in progress.\\\\nOn 05\\\\/21\\\\/2018 and 05\\\\/22\\\\/2018, our investigator [NV]observed[E] that plastic utensils were [NV]kept[E] inside this [PV]single[E] compartment sink and were being cleaned with [PV]water[E] and [PV]soap[E] alone. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2015 inspection. \\\\n6.    Your [PV]firm[E] [NV]failed[E] to [PV]provide[E] adequate screening or other protection against pests as required by 21 CFR 110.20(b)(7).  Specifically, our investigator [NV]observed[E] [PV]windows[E] in [PV]processing[E] [PV]area[E] did not have any [PV]type[E] of screening and doors [PV]leading[E] to the receiving and\\\\/or dispatching of [PV]raw[E] materials and finished products have a gap of approximately four (4) inches wide at the bottom. A [PV]second[E] [PV]door[E] connecting the exterior of the [PV]firm[E] with this warehouse had a gap of approximately [PV]two[E] (2) inches wide at the bottom. Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009 and 2015 inspections. \\\\n \\\\n7.    You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] buildings, fixtures or other physical [PV]facilities[E] in a [PV]sanitary[E] [NV]condition[E] as required by 21 CFR 110.35(a). Specifically, our investigator [NV]observed[E] that the [PV]floors[E] in your [PV]processing[E] [PV]area[E] are not constructed from a [PV]material[E] that could be easily cleaned and [NV]kept[E] clean. Gaps in between [PV]floor[E] tiles had accumulated [NV]dirt[E] and [PV]black[E] [NV]stains[E] that appeared to be mold. In addition, walls in the [PV]processing[E] [PV]area[E] had [PV]sections[E] of [NV]missing[E] tiles and [PV]showed[E] presence of what appeared to be mold. During the inspection, your [PV]firm[E] was formulating \\'Sofrito\\' (Condiment Mix) and \\'Ajo\\' (Raw Grounded Garlic) finished products. (Repeat [PV]observation[E] from our 2009, 2010, and 2015 inspections).\\\\n \\\\nWe note that you have not provided a [PV]written[E] [PV]response[E] to the Form FDA 483, Investigator Observations, [NV]issued[E] to you on June 01, 2018. Please be [PV]aware[E] that without a [PV]written[E] response, we are [NV]unable[E] to [PV]assess[E] your [PV]understanding[E] of the [PV]observations[E] and any [PV]potential[E] corrective [PV]actions[E] to voluntarily comply with applicable regulations.\\\\n \\\\nIn addition, we have [PV]determined[E] that your [PV]facility[E] is [PV]subject[E] to the biennial registration renewal requirement in \\\\u00a7 415(a)(3) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 350d(a)(3), which requires submission of a renewal registration during the [NV]period[E] [PV]beginning[E] on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, and our implementing regulation at 21 CFR Part 1, Subpart H. During the current inspection of your facility, you were advised of this requirement.  Failure to re-register a [PV]facility[E] is a prohibited act under \\\\u00a7 301(dd) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331 (dd).  Our [PV]records[E] indicate that, to date, this [PV]facility[E] has not been re-registered with FDA.\\\\n \\\\nAs a [PV]responsible[E] official of a [PV]facility[E] that manufactures\\\\/processes, packs, or [PV]holds[E] [PV]food[E] for human or [PV]animal[E] [PV]consumption[E] in the United States, you are [PV]responsible[E] for ensuring that your overall [NV]operation[E] and the products you distribute are in compliance with the law.\\\\n \\\\nWe request you register your [PV]facility[E] with FDA within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from receipt of this letter. Registration may be [PV]accomplished[E] on-line at http:\\\\/\\\\/www.access.fda.gov. We strongly encourage the use of electronic registration because it will [PV]result[E] in an automatic confirmation of registration and automatic issuance of a registration number. Alternatively, you may register the [PV]facility[E] by [PV]mail[E] or fax (e.g., if you do not have [PV]reasonable[E] access to the Internet) [PV]using[E] FDA\\\\u2019s [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] registration form, Form FDA 3537. This [PV]form[E] may be obtained by calling the FDA Industry Systems Help Desk at 1-800-216-7331 or 301-575-0156, or by [PV]writing[E] to the Agency at the [PV]following[E] address:\\\\n \\\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, HFS-681\\\\n5600 Fishers Lane\\\\nRockville, MD 20857\\\\n \\\\nWhen completed, the [PV]form[E] may be faxed to (301) 210-0247 or mailed to the [PV]address[E] above. FDA will [PV]process[E] registrations [PV]submitted[E] by [PV]mail[E] or fax and [PV]provide[E] a facility\\\\u2019s registration number [PV]using[E] the same [PV]method[E] [NV]used[E] to [PV]submit[E] the registration to FDA.\\\\n \\\\nThis [PV]letter[E] is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the [NV]violations[E] at your facility. It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and in the Inspectional Observations, Form FDA 483, [NV]issued[E] at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of [PV]serious[E] [NV]problems[E] in your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]manufacturing[E] systems. You should investigate and [PV]determine[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] and [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]actions[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] to bring your products into compliance. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further [PV]notice[E] including [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nSection 743 of the Act, [21 USC 379j-31], authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA\\\\u2019s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, [21 USC 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility.  The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any re-inspection-related costs.\\\\n \\\\nPlease notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from receipt of this [PV]letter[E] as to the specific [PV]steps[E] you have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] the stated violations, including an [PV]explanation[E] of each [PV]step[E] being [NV]taken[E] to [PV]identify[E] [NV]violations[E] and [PV]make[E] corrections to [PV]ensure[E] that similar [NV]violations[E] will not recur.

During the current inspection of your facility, you were advised of this requirement.  Failure to re-register a [PV]facility[E] is a prohibited act under \\\\u00a7 301(dd) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \\\\u00a7 331 (dd).

Registration may be [PV]accomplished[E] on-line at http:\\\\/\\\\/www.access.fda.gov. We strongly encourage the use of electronic registration because it will [PV]result[E] in an automatic confirmation of registration and automatic issuance of a registration number. Alternatively, you may register the [PV]facility[E] by [PV]mail[E] or fax (e.g., if you do not have [PV]reasonable[E] access to the Internet) [PV]using[E] FDA\\\\u2019s [PV]food[E] [PV]facility[E] registration form, Form FDA 3537. This [PV]form[E] may be obtained by calling the FDA Industry Systems Help Desk at 1-800-216-7331 or 301-575-0156, or by [PV]writing[E] to the Agency at the [PV]following[E] address:\\\\n \\\\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration, HFS-681\\\\n5600 Fishers Lane\\\\nRockville, MD 20857\\\\n \\\\nWhen completed, the [PV]form[E] may be faxed to (301) 210-0247 or mailed to the [PV]address[E] above.

It is your responsibility to [PV]ensure[E] compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific [NV]violations[E] [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] and in the Inspectional Observations, Form FDA 483, [NV]issued[E] at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of [PV]serious[E] [NV]problems[E] in your firm\\\\u2019s [PV]manufacturing[E] systems. You should investigate and [PV]determine[E] the [NV]causes[E] of the [NV]violations[E] and [PV]take[E] [PV]prompt[E] [PV]actions[E] to [PV]correct[E] the [NV]violations[E] to bring your products into compliance. Failure to promptly [PV]correct[E] these [NV]violations[E] may [PV]result[E] in legal [PV]action[E] without further [PV]notice[E] including [NV]seizure[E] and injunction.\\\\n \\\\nSection 743 of the Act, [21 USC 379j-31], authorizes FDA to [PV]assess[E] and collect fees to [PV]cover[E] FDA\\\\u2019s costs for [PV]certain[E] activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is [PV]one[E] or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act, specifically to [PV]determine[E] whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA\\\\u2019s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the [PV]results[E] of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, [21 USC 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will [PV]assess[E] and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the [PV]responsible[E] [PV]party[E] for the domestic facility.  The inspection [PV]noted[E] in this [PV]letter[E] [PV]identified[E] noncompliance materially related to a [PV]food[E] [PV]safety[E] requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may [PV]assess[E] fees to [PV]cover[E] any re-inspection-related costs.\\\\n \\\\nPlease notify this [PV]office[E] in [PV]writing[E] within fifteen (15) [PV]working[E] [PV]days[E] from receipt of this [PV]letter[E] as to the specific [PV]steps[E] you have [NV]taken[E] to [PV]correct[E] the stated violations, including an [PV]explanation[E] of each [PV]step[E] being [NV]taken[E] to [PV]identify[E] [NV]violations[E] and [PV]make[E] corrections to [PV]ensure[E] that similar [NV]violations[E] will not recur. In your response, you should [PV]include[E] documentation, including copies of records, photographs or other [NV]useful[E] [PV]information[E] that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in [NV]violation[E] of the Act, [PV]include[E] your reasoning and any supporting [PV]information[E] for our consideration.

Nesbitt, Owner\\\\n2180 Piney Grove Loop Road\\\\nOlivehill, Tennessee 38475\\\\n \\\\nDear Mr. Nesbitt:\\\\n \\\\nOn March 13 and 22, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an investigation of your cattle operation, located at 2108 Piney Grove Loop Road, Olivehill, Tennessee, as a follow up to a sulfamethazine residue that was found in a slaughtered bull. This letter notifies you of the violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that we found during our investigation of your operation. You can find the Act and its associated regulations through links on FDA\\\\u2019s Internet web page at www.fda.gov. \\\\n \\\\nWe found that you hold animals under conditions that are so inadequate that medicated animals bearing potentially harmful drug residues are likely to enter the food supply. You failed to maintain treatment records and you failed to identify animals transported and delivered for sale. Food from animals held under such conditions is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 342(a)(4).\\\\n \\\\nWe also found that you adulterated the new animal drug Sustain III\\\\u00ae Bolus (sulfamethazine, NADA 120-615). Specifically, our investigation revealed that you did not use this drug as directed by its approved labeling. Use of this drug in this manner is an extralabel use. See Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations Part 530.3(a) (21 C.F.R. \\\\u00a7 530.3(a)).\\\\n \\\\nThe extralabel use of approved animal or human drugs in animals is allowed under the FD&C Act only if the extralabel use complies with sections 512(a)(4) and (5) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 360b(a)(4) and (5), and 21 CFR Part 530, including that the use must be by or on the lawful order of a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinarian\\\\/client\\\\/patient relationship. \\\\n \\\\nDuring our investigation, you admitted to administering Sustain III\\\\u00ae, an over the counter (OTC) product, to a black bull without following the indications for use and the route of administration, as stated in the approved labeling. Under your supervision, this black bull was treated with Sustain III\\\\u00ae for \\\\u201cbeing old and slow\\\\u201d by crushing and mixing three (3) boluses of Sustain III\\\\u00ae to feed. Sustain III\\\\u00ae is not approved for these conditions. Additionally, the label states in part \\\\u201c\\\\u2026care should be taken not to crush the bolus\\\\u201d. Using OTC products in an extralabel manner requires a lawfully written order from a veterinarian. Your extralabel use of Sustain III\\\\u00ae was not under the supervision of a licensed veterinarian, in violation of 21 CFR \\\\u00a7 530.11(a) as illegal extralabel use of a drug.   \\\\n \\\\nBecause your use of this drug was not in conformance with its approved labeling and did not comply with 21 CFR Part 530, you caused the drug to be unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).\\\\n \\\\nThe above is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations. As a producer of animals offered for use as food, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the food you distribute is in compliance with the law.\\\\n \\\\nYou should take prompt action to correct the violations described in this letter and to establish procedures to ensure that these violations do not recur. Failure to do so may result in regulatory action without further notice such as seizure and\\\\/or injunction. \\\\n \\\\nYou should notify this office in writing of the steps you have taken to bring your firm into compliance with the law within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter. Your response should include each step that has been taken or will be taken to correct the violations and prevent their recurrence. If corrective action cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days of receiving this letter, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be completed. Please include copies of any available documentation demonstrating that corrections have been made.\\\\n \\\\nYour written response should be sent to Kimberly A. Dutzek, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 404 BNA Drive, Building 200, Suite 500, Nashville, Tennessee 37217. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Mrs. Dutzek at (615) 366-7826.\\\\n \\\\nSincerely,\\\\n\\\\/S\\\\/ \\\\nSteven B.

G. Nesbitt, Owner\\\\n2180 Piney Grove Loop Road\\\\nOlivehill, Tennessee 38475\\\\n \\\\nDear Mr. Nesbitt:\\\\n \\\\nOn March 13 and 22, 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an investigation of your [PV]cattle[E] operation, located at 2108 Piney Grove Loop Road, Olivehill, Tennessee, as a [PV]follow[E] up to a sulfamethazine [NV]residue[E] that was [PV]found[E] in a slaughtered bull. This [PV]letter[E] notifies you of the [NV]violations[E] of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that we [PV]found[E] during our investigation of your operation. You can [PV]find[E] the Act and its associated regulations through [PV]links[E] on FDA\\\\u2019s Internet web [PV]page[E] at www.fda.gov. \\\\n \\\\nWe [PV]found[E] that you [PV]hold[E] [PV]animals[E] under [NV]conditions[E] that are so [NV]inadequate[E] that medicated [PV]animals[E] [PV]bearing[E] potentially [NV]harmful[E] drug residues are [PV]likely[E] to [PV]enter[E] the [PV]food[E] supply. You [NV]failed[E] to [PV]maintain[E] treatment [PV]records[E] and you [NV]failed[E] to [PV]identify[E] [PV]animals[E] transported and [PV]delivered[E] for sale. Food from [PV]animals[E] [PV]held[E] under such [NV]conditions[E] is adulterated within the [PV]meaning[E] of [PV]section[E] 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 342(a)(4).\\\\n \\\\nWe also [PV]found[E] that you adulterated the new [PV]animal[E] drug Sustain III\\\\u00ae Bolus (sulfamethazine, NADA 120-615).
